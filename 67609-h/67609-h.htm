<p>It has been thought well and due, by those who knew the
late J. G. Campbell of Tiree, to give to the public more tales
collected by him, and his sister has made over the following
collection, selected by herself from among the tales gathered in
the course of many years. We send them forth as a fitting
memorial to his memory, and as another stone added to the
cairn lovingly erected by old friends. At the end will be found
a few letters which passed between the late minister and the
late Iain Campbell of Islay, showing the methods of collecting
followed by these two lovers of the folk-lore of their native
land, and which in consequence cannot but prove of interest
and value to those who have followed the steps of the gleaning
of folk-tales throughout the British Isles&mdash;we may add throughout
the world. These patient labourers in such fields were the
true pioneers of the movement in Scotland.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Memoir of the late John Gregorson Campbell,<br/>
Minister of Tiree.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[<i>The following Memoir is chiefly from information given by Mr.
Campbell’s sister, Mrs. Wallace of Hynish, thanks to whose
unwearied and sympathetic assistance it was that the previous
volume in the series, ‘The Fians,’ was made ready for and
passed through the press, and that the present volume has
been selected and put together from the mass of the material
left by the author</i>].</p>
</div>


<p>John Gregorson Campbell was born at Kingairloch, in
Argyllshire, in the year 1836, the second son and fourth child
of Captain Campbell of the <i>Cygnet</i> and of Helen MacGregor,
his wife. The fondness for study, the devotion to his native
literature and lore, which were such marked features of his life,
and which earned for him an abiding reputation as a Gaelic
student, would seem to have been his by birthright. His
maternal grandfather was an ardent Gael, as may be judged by
the letters that passed between him and Dr. Mackintosh. On
his mother’s side he was descended from Duncan MacGregor,
13th in direct descent from the first MacGregor who settled at
Roro, in Glenlyon, Perthshire, whilst through a paternal
ancestor he traced back to a race that had had dealings with
the ‘good people,’ and on whom a <i>bean shith</i> had laid the spell
‘they shall grow like the rush and wither like the fern’ (<i>fàsaidh
iad mar an luachair ’s crìonaidh iad mar an raineach</i>).</p>

<p>The house of his birth on the shores of Loch Linnhe was
small and lonely, and when he was three years of age his parents
removed to Appin. His childhood was that of many young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span>
Highlanders. From earliest boyhood he attended the parish
school in the Strath of Appin, walking daily with his older
sisters the long stretch that separated it from his father’s home.
He loved to recall his early schooldays, and their memory was
ever dear to him. He had learnt more, he was wont to say in
after years, at that school than at all his other schools put
together. And on the hillside and along the valley, traversed
twice daily, he drank in a love for and knowledge of nature in
all her manifestations that remained to him as a priceless
possession throughout life. At ten he was sent to Glasgow for
further schooling, passed first through the Andersonian University,
and went thence to the High School, preparatory to
entering College. We have interesting glimpses of him at this
period. He seems to have been a dreamy, quick-witted but
somewhat indolent lad of whom his masters said, ‘if Campbell
likes to work no one can beat him’; hot-tempered too, as
Highlanders, rightly or wrongly, are credited with being. The
only Highlander in the school, he had doubtless much to put
up with. His Glasgow schoolfellows had probably as little
liking for Highlanders as Baillie Nicol Jarvie himself, and
many were the petty persecutions he had to endure. He has
himself related how he suffered several hours imprisonment for
fighting another boy ‘on account of my country.’ Like all who
are steadily bilingual from early youth he recognised how
powerful an intellectual instrument is the instinctive knowledge
of two languages, and was wont to insist upon the aid he had
derived from Gaelic in the study of Hebrew and Latin. To
one familiar with the complex and archaic organisation of
Gaelic speech the acquisition of these languages must indeed
be far easier than to one whose first knowledge of speech is
based upon the analytic simplicity of English.</p>

<p>From the High School he gladly passed to College, where a
happier life and more congenial friendships awaited him. He
had many Highland fellow-students, and at this early date his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</span>
love for the rich stores of oral tradition preserved by his
countrymen manifested itself. He sought the acquaintance of
good story-tellers, and began to store up in his keenly retentive
memory the treasure he has been so largely instrumental in
preserving and recording.</p>

<p>After leaving college he read law for awhile with Mr. Foulds.
In his lonely island parish he later found his legal training
of the utmost assistance. Many were the disputes he was
called upon to settle, and, as he has recorded, few there were
of his parishioners who needed to take the dangerous voyage to
the Sheriff’s court on a neighbouring island. At once judge
and jury his decisions commanded respect and acquiescence.
At this period, and for some time previously, his interest in and
mastery of Gaelic legendary lore are shown by the fact that he
acted as Secretary to the Glasgow University Ossianic Society,
founded in 1831 by <i>Caraid nan Gàidheal</i>, and still flourishing.</p>

<p>His thoughts and aspirations had early turned towards the
church, and in 1858 he was licensed by the Presbytery of
Glasgow. But suffering as he then was from the effects of
inflammation of the lungs, the result of a chill caught in his
student days, and the effects of which were perceptible throughout
life, he was forbidden to preach for six months. The
interval, spent in recruiting his shattered health, was profitable
to his growing zeal for folk-lore studies. In Ayrshire or at
Blair Athole he showed himself a keen and sympathetic
collector of floating oral tradition.</p>

<p>In 1860 he accepted the appointment to the united parishes
of Tiree and Coll from the Duke of Argyll, and took up the
work which was to occupy the remaining thirty years of his
life. It is to be wished that a sphere of activity more commensurate
with his abilities had been accepted by him, as when
he was offered the assistantship of St. Columba, Glasgow, and
he seems at times to have felt as much. But such thoughts
were certainly no hindrance to the performance of his duty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
interpreted in the largest and most liberal sense. He was the
guide and counsellor of his flock, who turned to him with
unfailing confidence for advice, exhortation, or reproof. An
amusing instance of his parishioners’ belief in his capacity may
be cited; a sailor lad from Tiree got, as sailor lads will, into
some row in Spain and was marched off to jail. He took the
matter philosophically, remarking, ‘so long as the minister is
alive I know they can’t hurt me’ (<i>bha fhios agam co fad’s a bha ’m
ministear beò nach robh cunnart domh</i>). The esteem and affection
in which he was held by his parishioners were cordially
reciprocated by him. He is reported as saying that nowhere
could be found a more intelligent community than the Duke’s
tenantry in Tiree, and in the preface to Volume IV. of the
present series he bears witness to the knowledge, intelligence,
and character of his informants.</p>

<p>We do not go far wrong in conjecturing that the minister’s
zealous interest for the preservation and elucidation of the
native traditions was not the least potent of his claims upon the
respect and love of his flock. How keenly the Highlander
still treasures these faint echoes of the past glories and sorrows
of his race is known to all who have won his confidence.
Unhappily it has not always been the case that this sentiment
has been fostered and turned to good account by the natural
leaders of the people as it was by John Gregorson Campbell.</p>

<p>In the guidance of his people, in congenial study, in correspondence
with Campbell of Islay and other fellow-workers,
specimens of which will be found in the appendix (<i>infra</i> 138),
time passed. His mother died in 1890 at the manse,
and his health, for long past indifferent, broke down. The
last years of his life were solaced and filled by the work he
prepared for the present series. At last, Nov. 22nd, 1891
he passed from his labours and sufferings into rest, the rest of
one who had well earned it by devotion to duty and to the
higher interests of his race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span></p>

<p>In person Campbell was tall and fair, with deep blue eyes
full of life and vivacity. He was noted at once for the kindliness
of his manner, and for the shrewd causticity of his wit.
The portrait which serves as frontispiece is taken from the only
available photograph, and represents him in middle life.</p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">His Work as a Folk-Lorist.</span></p>

<p>The Gaels of Scotland cannot be accused of indifference to
the rich stores of legend current among the people. From the
days of the Dean of Lismore, in the late 15th century, onwards,
there have not been wanting lovers and recorders of the old
songs and stories. Unfortunately, in the 18th century, a new
direction was given to the national interest in the race traditions
by the Macpherson controversy. I say unfortunately, because
attention was thereby concentrated upon one section of tradition
to the neglect of others equally interesting and beautiful,
and false standards were introduced into the appreciation and
criticism of popular oral literature. Valuable as are the
materials accumulated in the Report of the Highland Society,
and generally in the voluminous literature which grew up round
Macpherson’s pretentions, they are far less valuable than they
might be to the folk-lorist and student of the past, owing to the
misapprehension of the real points both of interest and at issue.
Two generations had to pass away before Scotch Gaelic folk-lore
was to be studied and appreciated for itself.</p>

<p>To Campbell of Islay and the faithful fellow-workers whom he
knew how to inspire and organise, falls the chief share in this
work, belongs the chief honour of its successful achievement.
The publication of the <i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>
was epoch-making, not only in the general study of folk-lore,
but specially for the appreciation and intelligence of Gaelic
myth and romance. No higher praise can be given to John
Gregorson Campbell than that his folk-lore work is full of
the same uncompromising fidelity to popular utterance, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
same quick intuition into, and sympathetic grasp of popular
imagination as Islay’s. His published work has indeed a
somewhat wider range than that of <i>Leabhar na Feinne</i> and
the <i>Popular Tales of the West Highlands</i>, as it deals also
with those semi-historic traditions, the nearest equivalent the
literature of these islands can show to the Icelandic family sagas,
which Islay excluded from the two collections he issued. The
following is a complete list, so far as can be ascertained, of
the published writings of John Gregorson Campbell, in so far as
they relate to the legendary romance, history and folk-lore of
Gaelic Scotland.</p>

<p class="p2">In presenting his material to the English reader Campbell may
profitably be compared with Islay. In few ways was the
work of the latter more fruitful than in his mode of rendering
Gaelic into English. It is impossible, for instance, to look at
the work done of late by the distinguished Irish folk-lorists who
are adding a new chapter to Gaelic romance, at the work of
Douglas Hyde and W. Larminie and Jeremiah Curtin, and not
recognise how much in point of colour and tone and smack
of the soil their translations excel those of the pre-Campbell
generation. Islay may, at times, have pushed his theory of
idiomatic fidelity too far, occasionally where he aims at a
rendering he achieves a distortion, but as a whole the effect of
strange, wild, archaic atmosphere and medium is given with
unerring&mdash;one would call it skill, did one not feel that it is the
outcome of a nature steeped in the Gaelic modes of conception
and expression, and bold enough to invent the English requisite
to give an adumbration of them. For indeed the speech of
the <i>Popular Tales</i> is a distinctive variety of English, deserving
study both from the philologist and the artist in words. Islay
himself never handled this speech to better effect than did John
Gregorson Campbell in the fine tale, for instance, of Sir Olave
O’Corn (<i>Gaelic Soc. of Inverness</i>, Vol. XIII.), or in the
<i>Muileartach</i> (<i>Waifs and Strays</i>, Vol. IV.), though as a rule he
keeps closer than Islay to the ordinary standard of English
expression. Readers of this volume cannot fail to note the
exceeding skill with which the pithy, imaginative turns of
thought, so plentiful in the original, are rendered into English.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
The reader is at once taken out of nineteenth century civilisation,
and, which is surely the first thing required from the
translator, by the mere sound and look of the words carried
back into an older, wilder, simpler and yet, in some ways, more
artificially complex life. The difficulty of rendering Gaelic into
English does not lie in the fact of its possessing a rude
simplicity which the more sophisticated language is incapable
of reproducing, but rather in that, whilst the emotions and
conceptions are close to the primitive passions of nature in a
degree that our civilisation has long forsworn, the mode of
expression has the richness of colour and elaborate artificiality
of a pattern in the Book of Kells. To neglect the latter
characteristic is to miss not only a salient feature of the original
but to obscure the significance of a dominant factor in the
evolution of Gaelic artistry.</p>

<p>That Campbell, like Islay, felt the paramount necessity
of endeavouring to reproduce the formal characteristics of
his Gaelic text is certain; like Islay, he too, had the true
scholar’s regard for his matter. To put down what he
heard, to comment upon what he found, was his practice.
It seems obvious, but many collectors neglect it all the same.
Nor in his essays at interpretation is he other than in full
sympathy with his subject. He not only understands but
himself possesses the mythopoeic faculty, and if this is
endowed with a wider knowledge, a more refined culture than
belonged to the Gaelic bards who first gave these songs and
stories their present shape, or to the peasants and fishermen who
lovingly repeat them, it differs in degree only, not in kind. It
may be doubted that the framers of the <i>Muileartach</i> consciously
embodied the conceptions which Campbell has read into the
old poem (<i>Waifs and Strays</i>, IV. pp. 131–135), but I think
it certain that he does but give shape with the precision of a
a higher culture to ideas which, with them, never emerged from
the stage of mythic realisation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span></p>


<p class="center p2"><span class="smcap">The Present Work.</span></p>

<p>Most of the matter contained in the present volume had been
partially, if not definitely, prepared for press by the author.
The choice and arrangement are largely due to his sister, Mrs.
Wallace, his devoted fellow-worker. Still it must not be forgotten
that we have here a collection of posthumous remains
which have not enjoyed the benefit of the author’s final shaping
and revision. But it has been judged best by the editors of
the series to preserve these remains substantially as they were
left, with a minimum of indispensable revision. The volume
may lose in other respects, but it is, at all events, the work of
the author and not of his editor friends. The latter have
felt that regard for the genuineness of Mr. Campbell’s text was
the first of their duties towards his memory.</p>

<p>This volume thus represents the contents of Campbell’s
note-books rather than provides such an ordered collection of
material, bearing upon a particular section of Gaelic folk-lore,
as he has furnished in the preceding volume of this series.
But for this very reason it yields better evidence to the wealth
and variety of Gaelic popular tradition. A large portion of
the book is local legendary matter, and is closely analogous to
what the Icelandic Sagas must have been in one stage of their
development, a stage overlaid by the artistry of a greater school
of prose story tellers than ever took the sagas of Gaelic Scotland
in hand. Professor York Powell has well analysed the
phase through which such stories as those of Burnt Njal or
Egil Skallagrimm’s son must have passed before they reached
the form familiar to us.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He describes the popular narrator
working up a mass of local, fairly authentic detail about his
hero, running it into a conventional mould, and then fitting the
result into a scheme of wider historic scope. The Gaelic
matter preserved alike by Mr. Campbell in this volume and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
Mr. MacDougall in the first volume of the series has not got
beyond the local anecdote stage, though, as in the variant forms
of the tale of the Grizzled Lad and MacNeill (p. 5,
<i>et seq.</i>), we can see the conventionalizing process at work,
accentuating certain details, discarding others, with the view of
transmuting the blurred photographic variety of life into the
clear-cut unity of art. But the process is rudimentary. It is
strange that this should be so considering the wealth of conventional
situations that lay ready to the hand of the Gaelic
story teller in the highly elaborated sagas of Cuchulainn and of
Finn, for the purpose of moulding the achievements of historical
Campbells, MacLeans and MacNeills, into a satisfactory artistic
form. Such convention as is apparent in these scraps of sagas
is related to that of the folk-tale rather than to that of the great
heroic legends. An interesting example is afforded by the
story of Mac an Uidhir. This may well have a basis of fact,
indeed Campbell cites an actual analogue, but it has been run
into the shape of an ordinary separation and timely-recognition
folk-tale. Other instances will present themselves to the reader
and afford instructive study of the action and reaction upon
each other of folk-life and oral narrative legend.</p>

<p>Any fresh addition of moment to the considerable recorded
mass of Scottish local historic tradition increases the wonder
that material of such vigour and interest, full of the clash of
fierce primitive passion, rich in character, should have had
so little literary outcome. The stuff is not inferior to that of
the Icelandic tales, but instead of a first-rate contribution to
the world’s literature we have only a chaos of unworked up
details. Yet during the time that these implanted themselves
and took shape in the popular memory, Gaelic story-tellers,
elaborating and perpetually readapting the old mythic and
heroic traditions of the race, were producing narratives of rare
and exquisite charm. Perplexity is intensified if, as Professor
Zimmer maintains, the Norsemen learnt the art of prose narrative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>
from the Irish and developed the great school of Icelandic
story telling on lines picked up in Gaeldom. Certain it is that the
Irish annals, relating the events of the 3rd to 9th centuries,
which assumed their present shape sometime in the 10th
to the 12th centuries, contain a large amount of historic
narrative that is closely allied in form and spirit to the contemporary
Scotch Gaelic sagas. There is the same directness
of narrative, the frequent picturesqueness of incident, the pithy
characterisation; there is also the same failure to throw the
material into a rounded artistic form, and, most curious of all
resemblances, the conventions at work distorting historic fact
are those of the folk-tale rather than of the national heroic
epos. I would cite in this connection certain episodes of the
Boroma<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (in itself an admirable example of the failure of Gaelic
story tellers to work up into satisfying form very promising
historical material) such as that of Cumascach’s visit to
Brandubh, or again many passages in the stories about Raghallach
and Guaire. The whole subject is, as nearly everything
else in the record of Gaelic letters, fraught with fascinating
perplexities. The present writer can but here, as he has so
often done before, make a big note of interrogation and trust
that Gaelic scholars on both sides the water will consider the
problem worth study, and succeed in solving it.</p>

<p>I note those points which interest me as a student of tradition
in general, and of Celtic tradition in particular. For most
readers these scraps of local history derive their chief value
from the vivid light they flash back upon the past, from the
evidence they yield of the wild, fierce&mdash;I had almost written
savage&mdash;life from which we are separated by so few generations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
Some there may be to mourn for the past. Not a few Highland
landlords will possibly regret the good old days when the
MacLean planted his gallows in the midst of the island of
Tiree, and the last comer with his rent knew what awaited him
(p. 13). Truly a more effectual means of getting in the money
than by writ which the sheriff cannot execute.</p>

<p>The remainder of the volume comprises matter more upon
the usual folk-lore lines; much, familiar already but valuable
in the good variant form here recorded, much again novel, like
the curious tale of the Princess Thyra and her lovers. Taken
in conjunction with the author’s previous volume in this series
on the Finn tradition as still living in the Western Highlands,
the whole offers a faithful picture of the imagination, memory,
and humour of the Gaelic peasant playing round the old-time
beliefs, stories and customs handed down to him from his
forefathers.</p>

</div>


<p>The first MacLeans, Wily Lachlan (<i>Lachunn Lùbanach</i>), and
Punctilious Hector (<i>Eachann Reanganach</i>), came to Dunolly to
MacDougall. He sent them provisions and made his men
watch to see if they were gentlemen. It was inferred they
were, from their paring cheese, or, throwing the remains of
their food to the dogs. On leaving Dunolly they came to Aros
in Mull. This word Aros is the one regularly used to denote a
royal residence or palace, and the Lords of the Isles claiming
an independent sovereignty, their residence in Mull came to be
called Aros, a name which it still retains. Their residence in
the north was Duntulm, and in the Sound of Mull, Aros and
Ardtornish. The view from the old castle of Aros up and
down the Sound is very commanding, and that from Ardtornish
is equally so. The MacLeans on coming to Aros found
<i>Peddle Mòr</i> (a south country ploughman to <i>MacCónnuill</i> of the
Isles) who sent them food, but gave no knife and fork, telling
them to put hen’s bills on (<i>guib-chearc</i>) to take it. On coming
to him they found him bending to repair a failing in the plank
board (<i>fàillinn na fliuch-bhùird</i>), or keel board, of a galley
(<i>birlinn</i>) with which he was to go to meet his master.</p>

<p>The Lords of the Isles to make their estate appear greater
employed, from the name, evidently a south countryman at
agricultural work, hence the name Peddle which is not of
Highland origin. They struck off his head and went themselves
to meet MacCónnuill whom they took prisoner, and
brought to MacDougall. He however would take nothing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
do with the captive. At the advice of an old man they then
returned with their prisoner to Aros, and got him pledged to
give his daughter to one of them. Lachlan married the
daughter and got Dowart.</p>

<p>It is said by some that Hector was the oldest of the two
brothers, and that when MacCónnuill the Lord of the Isles was
out pleasure-sailing with his daughter, the brothers overtook his
galley and seizing him said “The omen of your capture has
overtaken you” (“<i>Tha manadh do ghlacaidh ort</i>”). He had
no ransom to offer but his daughter and lands. Lachlan took
the daughter, and with her he got the lands of Dowart. The
other got the lands of Lochbuy. MacCónnuill gave for food
to the child born of the Dowart marriage Little Hernisker with
its twenty-four islands (<i>Earnasgeir bheag le ’cuid eileanan</i>).
Afterwards, at Ardtornish, the fourth or fifth descendant of
Dowart asked the then Lord of the Isles for a livelihood
(<i>màthair bheathachaidh</i>). He got the reply, “Jump the wall
where it is lowest” (“<i>Leum an gàradh far an ìsle e</i>”) which
led to Ardgour being taken from MacMaster, who was known
at the time to be no favourite with the Lord of the Isles, and
the attack made upon his land was readily commuted into a
chartered possession. The tradition is as follows:</p>

<p>The Lord of the Isles was lying sick at Ardtornish. The
MacCónnuill, now commonly called MacDonald, claimed a
jurisdiction independent of the Scottish Crown till about 1493
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> or thereabouts, and many if not all the chiefs of the
Western Highlands and Islands paid him court. Among
others MacMaster, chief, or proprietor, of Ardgour, came
to pay his respects at that time. Ventilation was not
then so much regarded in the case of the sick as it is
now, and MacMaster, being offended at some breath from the
sick chamber, said <i>Fùich, fùich</i>, an expression of disgust and
offence. Unfortunately for himself the inadvertent expression
was made a handle of, and was never forgiven to MacMaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
by the Lord of the Isles. In consequence, when the Laird of
Dowart, who was married to a near relative of his, came to ask
for a means of livelihood (<i>màthair bheathachaidh</i>) to the child
born of his marriage with the kinswoman of the Lord of the
Isles, the potentate said to him, “Jump the wall where it is
lowest” (<i>Leum an gàradh far an ìsle e</i>). The youth or young
man being now of age to shift for himself, a company of men
and a boat was given him by his father, and he made for
Ardgour. A battle was then fought and MacMaster was
defeated. One of MacMaster’s sons, who was surnamed the
Fox (<i>An sionnach</i>), possibly because weakness often seeks to
protect itself by wiliness and deceit or any other artifice that
will give protection. In these stormy days any such means
were more excusable. The Fox made his way to go across at
Corran to the mainland after the battle. His father’s fisherman
was then fishing in the neighbourhood of the ferry at Red Bay
(<i>Port Dearg</i>), and the Fox called to him to throw him across
to the other side. The fisherman who rejoiced in the cacophonous
name of Carrascally (<i>Mac-a-Charrusglaich</i>), was deaf
to his cry, and he only said that the cuddie fish was taking well
(“<i>Gu ’n robh gabhail mhaith air na cudainnean</i>”) or that he
lost his oars, and the young MacMaster had to hide himself in
the adjoining wood. When the MacLeans came to the place,
Carrascally said that there was a fox of the MacMasters still
hiding in the wood, and the MacLeans pursued him. The
cairn, or heap of stones, is still shown where the Fox was
overtaken and slain.</p>

<p>Some say it was MacMaster himself, and not his son, who
was flying after the defeat by the MacLeans, and was refused
to be ferried by the fisherman, and that his son who was called
the Fox, and had committed some fraud when abroad, was
caught in Inverscaddel wood and was stabbed by MacLean.</p>

<p>The fisherman, who was rascally in more than name, came
to MacLean and made claim to having done good service in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
having refused to help the fugitive; and in having pointed out
that he was still in the wood. MacLean upon this put up
three oars and made a gallows with them, on which he hanged
the fisherman, or Carrascally, at the hangman’s cove (<i>Port-a-chrochaire</i>),
saying if he had treated his master as he said he
had done, it might be his turn another day, and the fisherman’s
cunning recoiling upon himself has passed into a proverb “The
officiousness, or discretionary power of MacCarrascally chasing
MacMaster’s Fox,” (“<i>Meachanus Mhic a’ Charrasglaich ruith
Sionnach Mhic a’ Mhaighstir</i>”). The MacLeans have ever
since retained Ardgour, and have been esteemed for their
position as Highland proprietors. Their title in Gaelic is
<i>Mac-’Ic-Eoghain</i> (the son of the son of Hugh). The son of
the son of, or grandson, (<i>Mac-’Ic-</i>) being the word used in the
Highlands of Scotland as the patronymic of Chiefs, instead of
the O, or Grandson, used in Ireland, as O’ Donnell, O’ Brian,
O’ Meagher, &amp;c. Thus, the son of the son of Patrick (<i>Mac-’Ic-Phàdruig</i>)
denotes Grant of Glenmoriston; the son of the
son of Alexander (<i>Mac-’Ic-Alasdair</i>), the Chief of Glengarry;
son of the son of Hector (<i>Mac-’Ic-Eachuinn</i>), MacLean who
had once Kingairloch. The title of some Chiefs is only son
of (<i>Mac</i>); as, Lochiel is known as the son of Dark Donald
(<i>Mac Dho’uil Duibh</i>). The leading Highland Chief is known as
<i>Mac Cailein</i> (the son of Colin). The House of Argyll derives
its Gaelic title from Colin, who was slain in a clan feud at the
battle on the mountain known as the String of Lorn (<i>An
t-Sreang Lathurnach</i>) when the ford, known as the Red Ford
(<i>Ath Dearg</i>), ran red with blood.</p>

DEATH OF BIG LACHLAN MACLEAN,<br/>
CHIEF OF DUART,&mdash;<br />
<span class="p85">(<i>Lachunn Mòr Dhuart</i>).</span></h3></div>


<p class="p1_5">The Chiefs of Duart were among the most powerful and
influential chiefs in the Highlands. Their power was absolute,
bearing the control of neither King nor Parliament, and there
are many stories shewing that they were very unsparing in
visiting with their vengeance, and even taking the lives of those
who offended them.</p>

<p>A very notorious sea-robber and land plunderer of whom
there are many tales in the Isle of Skye raised a <i>creach</i>, or
cattle-spoil, from MacDonald Lord of the Isles, who then
occupied a fort on the site of the present manse of Kilchoman
in Islay. He managed also to circulate a report that it was the
MacLeans from Mull who were the depredators. At that time
MacLean, Duart, was ambitious to be overlord of a great
part of Islay, and <i>Lachunn Mòr</i> came with a band of followers
to Gruinard beach in the neighbourhood of the fort.</p>

<p>It is said that before leaving Mull, he was standing on the roof
of Aros Castle which overlooks the Sound of Mull and on its
being pointed out that an expedition to Islay would be very
dangerous to his men, he said, that he did not care though
there should not be a MacLean in Mull except those descended
from himself. Neither he himself nor his men came back
from the ill-fated expedition. After landing at Gruinard beach
(<i>Tràigh Ghrunnard</i>) he was met by the MacDonalds. A little
man, known in tradition as the Black Elf (<i>Dubh Sith</i>) and
(<i>Ochd-rann bodaich</i>), or eighth part of a man&mdash;[In Scotch the
eighth part would be the lippie used for measuring grain and
meal. According to the table to be found in old Reckoning
Books a boll consists of two pecks and each peck of four lippies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
This makes each lippie equal to an eighth part of a boll],&mdash;offered
his services for the battle to MacLean, but the haughty
Chief rejected the offer with disdain. The Black Elf then
went to MacDonald, who accepted his offer; and during all the
current of the heady fight the dwarf was observed to follow
MacLean for an opportunity to kill him with an arrow. An
opportunity having at last occurred by MacLean lifting his
arm, an arrow was launched and MacLean was pierced on the
side, and fell with a deadly wound. Having lost their Chief
the MacLeans were routed with loss, and those who escaped
from the battle, having taken refuge in a neighbouring church,
were destroyed by the MacDonalds, who set the church on fire.
The body of Lachunn Mòr was taken on a sledge, there being
no wheeled vehicles in those days, to Kilchoman burying-ground.
Some say that the person who took him was his wife,
and others say it was his foster-mother. His head from the
motion of the sledge nodded in a manner that made the boy
who accompanied her laugh. She was so much offended at his
ill-timed merriment that she took a sword and killed him on
the spot. The site of this tragedy in Benviger is still pointed
out and the place where Lachunn Mòr himself was buried
is known to the people of the place although no headstone
marks it.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="MACLEANS_OF_COLL">MACLEANS OF COLL.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Laird of Dowart was on his way to gather rent in Tiree,
and sent ashore to Kelis (<i>Caolas</i>), Coll, for meat (<i>biadhtachd</i>).
The woman of the house told MacLean was not worth sending
meat to, and Dowart kindly came ashore to see why she said
so. She said it because he was not taking Coll for himself.
Three brothers from Lochlin had Coll at the time, Big Annla
(<i>Annla Mòr</i>) in Loch Annla, another in <i>Dun bithig</i> in Totronald,
and the third in Grisipol hill. She had thirty men
herself fit to bear arms. Dowart went to Loch Annla fort late
in the evening alone, and was hospitably received. Annla’s
arrows were near the fire, and Dowart gradually edged near
them till he managed to make off with them. This led to a
fight at Grimsari and is perhaps the reason why Dowart encouraged
<i>Iain Garbh</i> to make himself master of Coll.</p>

<p>Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) was the fourth MacLean,&mdash;others say
the first of Coll. When nine or twelve months old, his mother,
having become a widow, had married MacNeill of Barra, <i>Iain
Garbh</i> was sent by his step-father to Barra, in charge of a
nurse (<i>ban-altruim</i>). This woman was courted by a Barra-man,
whom, as her charge was a pretty boy, she at first refused.
Her lover, however, got word that <i>Iain Garbh</i> was to be killed
at MacNeill’s instigation, and told her. The three fled, in a
boat with two oars, from Barra during night. An eight-oared
galley (<i>ochd ràmhach</i>), with a steersman set off in chase. At
Sorisdale in Coll, beyond Eilereig, in the borderline (crìch)
between Sorisdale and Boust, there is a narrow sound, for
which both boats were making, and the little one was almost
overtaken. It was overtake and not overtake (<i>beir‘s cha bheir</i>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
The little boat went through the sound (<i>caolas</i>) safely, but the
oars of the large boat were broken. Hence, ’The Sound of
Breaking Oars’ (<i>Caolas ’Bhriste-Ràmh</i>) is the name of the
Sound to this day. The little boat put to sea again, and was
lost to sight. The Barra men went to every harbour near,
“The Wooded Bay” (<i>Bàgh na Coille</i>) &amp;c., where they thought
it might come, but they never saw it again. It is supposed it
went to Mull. There is no further mention of the Barra man
or the nurse. Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) went to Ireland, and
when well grown told the woman with whom he stayed that he
had a dream of a pile of oaten cakes (<i>tòrr de bhonnaich choirce</i>)
and a drip from the roof (<i>boinne snithe</i>), had fallen and gone
right through them. The woman said the dream meant he was
a laird of land (<i>ceannard fearainn</i>) and would get back his own.
On this he came to Mull, and having got men, of whom seven
were from Dervaig, the baldheaded black fellow, (<i>gille maol
dubh</i>) afterwards known as Grizzled Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>)
being one of them with him, went to Coll. His companions
vowed to kill whatever living (<i>beò</i>) they fell in with first, after
landing in Coll. Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) had a mark on
the forehead by his having fallen on the edge of an iron pot.
His foster-mother (<i>muime</i>) was gathering shellfish (<i>buain maoraich</i>).
He went to speak to her, when he came behind her as
she stumbled, and she exclaimed, “God be with MacLean”
(“<i>Dia le Mac-’illeathain</i>”), “My loss that MacLean is not alive”
(“<i>Mo sgaradh nach bu mhairionn do Mhac-’illeathain</i>”). When
pressed to explain herself she said, “Conceal what I said:
many an unfortunate word women say” (“<i>Dean rùn maith
orm: is ioma facal tubaisdeach their na mnathan</i>”), and at last
he told her his story. It had been long foretold that he would
return. The Mull men came up, and the Grizzled Lad (<i>Gille
Riabhach</i>) was going to kill the woman, according to the vow.
Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) told who she was, and her life was
spared. She informed them that MacNeill sent a servant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
every day from Grisipol House, where his headquarters were,
to Breacacha for news. If all was well, the messenger was to
return riding slowly with his face to the horse’s tail; if any one
returned with him, a friend was to walk on the right of the
horse, a stranger (<i>fògarach</i>) on the left; and she said that he had
just left on his way home. Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) and his
companions left the Hidden Anchorage (<i>Acarsaid Fhalaich</i>)
and went to the top of the place called Desert (<i>Fàsach</i>). They
there saw the rider of the white horse at Arileòid. Stout John
(<i>Iain Garbh</i>) promised reward to any one who would intercept
him, before he reached Grisipol. The Grizzled Lad (<i>Gille
Riabhach</i>) said he would do so, if he got Dervaig, his
native place, rent free. MacLean promised this, but the
lad said, “Words may be great till it comes to solemn oaths”
(<i>Is mór briathran gun lughadh</i>), made him swear to the
deed. The Grizzled Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) set off, and above
the Broad Knoll (<i>Cnoc Leathan</i>) saw the horseman at the
township of Hough. When at the Stone of Moaning
(<i>Clach Ochanaich</i>), on the top of Ben Hough, he saw him
past Clabbach. He made for the road, near the present Free
Church Manse, and lay down, and pretending to be a beggar
began to hunt through his clothes. Where the Little Cairn of
the King’s Son (<i>Carnan mhic an Righ</i>) stands, the horseman
came up, was pulled off his horse and killed. The lad then
waited till his companions came up, and proceeded to Grisipol
with two on each side. It was dinner time, and his servant the
Black Lad (<i>Gille Dubh</i>) brought word to MacNeill of the party
coming. His wife, looking out of an opening, said one of the
party coming looked like her son. MacNeill exclaimed, “War
time is not a time for sleep” (“<i>Cha-n àm cadal an cogadh</i>”),
and went out to give battle. In the fight the Grizzled Lad
(<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) was hard pressed by the Black Lad, (<i>Gille
Dubh</i>), and sideways jumped the stream that runs past Grisipol
House at the place still known as the Grizzly Lad’s leap (<i>Leum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
a’ Ghille Riabhaich</i>) to avoid the blow of the battle-axe. The
axe stuck in the ground, and before it was recovered, the
Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>), jumping back, threw off the
Black Lad’s (<i>Gille Dubh</i>) head. Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) was
hard pressed by MacNeill himself, and both were out in the
sea at the foot of the stream.</p>

<p>“Disgrace on you MacLean, though it is enough that you
are being driven by the son of the skate-eating carl” (“<i>Miapadh
ort, a Mhic ’illeathainn, ’s leoir tha thu gabhail iomain roimh
Mhac bodach nan sgat</i>”), said the Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>)
coming up to them, and then calling to MacNeill, “I am not
in a mood to deceive you, there they are behind you” (“<i>Cha
bhi mi ’m brath foille dhuit, sin iad agad air do chùlthaobh</i>”),
and when MacNeill turned round the Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille
Riabhach</i>) threw off his head with the axe. The MacNeills
fled and were beset and killed in the Hollow of bones (<i>Slochd-nan-cnàmh</i>)
in the lower part of Grisipol Hill (<i>Iochdar Beinn
Ghrisipol</i>). They then returned to Grisipol, and MacNeill’s
widow, Stout John’s (<i>Iain Garbh’s</i>) mother, held up her child
a suckling (<i>ciocharan</i>), that Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) might
spare him and acknowledge his own half-brother. He was for
sparing it, but the Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) told him to
put the needle on the ploughshare (<i>cuir an t-snathad air
a’ choltar</i>). The child was killed.</p>

<p>An additional if not a different account is:</p>

<p>Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) first of Coll, when a boy, was
obliged to fly from Coll to Dowart, and his mother married
MacNeill of Barra. When he came of age, and was for
making good his claim to his native island, in raising the clan
he came to a widow’s house in Dervaig. She said her other
sons were away, or they would be at his service, and she had
only a big stripling of a grizzly looking lad (<i>Stiall mòr de ghille
riabhach</i>) if he choose to take him. He took him, and it was
well for him he did. It is said that this family of whom the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) was one, and whose services were
at MacLean’s command, were Campbells. MacNeill kept a
man with a white horse at Arinagour, and if the MacLeans
were heard to land in the island, he was to ride off at full speed
to Breacacha. If anything was wrong the messenger was to
turn his head to the horse’s tail when he came in sight of
Breacacha. The Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) took across the
hill, where there is now a straight road, and intercepted this
rider. On hearing from him that MacNeill was at Grisipol, he
suddenly leapt behind him on the horse, and killed him with
his dirk. He rode back to his own party, and then slowly to
Grisipol where the MacNeills were at dinner.</p>

<p>MacLean and his men were faint and weary for want of
food. They had not tasted anything since they left Mull.
They entered a tenant’s house and asked food. The man had
nothing for them, once he had enough, but since the MacLeans
had left the island, he had come to grief and poverty. He
said to Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) his heart warmed to him, he
was so like his ancient masters. On learning who they were
he gave all the milk he had to them.</p>

<p>At the fight at Grisipol, the Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>)
was hard pressed by MacNeill’s body servant, who was armed
with a battle-axe. On the margin of the stream, as the axe
was raised to strike down, he leaped backwards, and upwards,
across the stream, and the place of the leap is still known as
the ‘Grizzly Lad’s leap’ (<i>Leum a’ Ghille Riabhaich</i>). The axe
went into the ground, and before MacNeill’s man could defend
himself the Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) jumped back and
threw off his head.</p>

<p>Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) himself was hard pressed by
MacNeill, and driven to the beach. The Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille
Riabhach</i>) came to his rescue. MacNeill’s wife cried out to
Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) her son by her first marriage, that his
enemies were coming behind him. The Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
Riabhach</i>) called out to him to watch his enemies in front, and
he would watch those behind.</p>

<p>MacNeill and his men were killed. The Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille
Riabhach</i>) said he would take to flight and pretend to be one
of the MacNeills, of whom another party was coming to the
rescue from Breacacha. He fled and made signals to the
MacNeills to fly. They fled to a cave near the Hidden
Anchorage (<i>Acarsaid fhalaich</i>) where their bones are still
to be seen.</p>

<p>When Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) entered Grisipol house, his
mother stood before him with a child, his half brother, on her
shoulder. She told him to look at his young brother smiling
at him. Stout John (<i>Iain Garbh</i>) was for sparing the infant
but the Grizzly Lad (<i>Gille Riabhach</i>) warned him, the child if
spared to come of age would avenge his father’s death, and he
himself stabbed the infant with his dirk on his mother’s
shoulder.</p>

<span class="p85">(<i>Clann-a-Bhruthain</i>).</span></h3></div>


<p class="p1_5">The Browns of Tiree at the present day are called <i>Brunaich</i>,
sing. <i>Brunach</i>, evidently a word not of native origin, and
likely an adaptation of the English Brown. Brown as the
name of a colour is an English word but not Gaelic, the Gaelic
for it being <i>donn</i>, hence as a clan name many affirm that the
Brown of the present day is a corruption or modification of
<i>Bruthainn</i> certainly the older name, and till very recently, the
name given to a sept or portion of the Browns. There are also
many who maintain that the oldest form of all is <i>Mac-’ill-duinn</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Other explanations are also put forward in behalf of the origin
of the name, but none of them are satisfactorily conclusive.
The following story of how the Browns came first to Tiree is a
tradition as like to be true as any other. It was heard from a
native of the island, well acquainted with the traditions of his
countrymen.</p>

<p>The wife of MacLean of Dowart was a daughter of the Lord
of the Isles. Her father on visiting her at Aros had found her
destitute of table-linen, and on her being spoken to on the subject,
she said that there was no place on the estate where lint could
be grown. Her father then gave her the island of Tiree as a
good flax-growing country, that she might not be open to that
reproach any longer. In this way the island of Tiree remained
in the possession of the Dowart family till the forfeiture of the
clan towards the end of the seventeenth century. The
MacLeans seem to have ruled the island with a rod of iron.
There is still shewn the hillock called the Bank of the Gallows
(<i>Bac na Croiche</i>), where the man who came in last with his
rent at collection time was hanged. A party of strong men
called ‘MacLean’s attributes’ (<i>buaidheanan Mhic-’illeathain</i>)
but more correctly oppressors and bullies, were kept in the
island to overawe the people.</p>

<p>This wife of Dowart, with her galley and men, was at Croig
in Mull, awaiting for a passage across to Tiree. When the
men were getting the galley in order, a big strong man was
observed making his way to the boat. His appearance was
that of a beggar, with tattered and patched garments (<i>lùirichean</i>).
He quietly asked to be allowed a passage with them. The
master of the boat gruffly refused, saying, that they would not
allow one like him to be in the same boat with their mistress,
but the beggar said that his being there would make no
difference, and asked the favour of getting a passage from her.
She gave him permission and he seated himself at the end of
the boat furthest from her to avoid giving trouble to her. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
day was becoming boisterous; it was not long till the master
said that the wind was becoming too high, and the day unlikely.
A heavy sea was shipped wetting the Lady of Dowart, and the
beggar said to the master, “Can you not steer better than
that?” The master said “Could you do better?” The beggar
replied “It would not be difficult for me to do better than that
at any rate. Show me the direction where you wish to go,”
and on it being shewn to him he added “I think you may go
on that you will make land.”</p>

<p>“What do you know?” the other said, “it is none of your
business to speak here.”</p>

<p>The Lady then spoke, and said to the beggar, “Will you
take the boat there if you get the command of it?” He said
he would, and she gave orders to let him have the command.
He sat at the helm and told them to shorten sail, and make
everything taut, and now, the boat did not take in a thimbleful
of water. They made for Tiree, and the place come to was
the lower part of Hynish, at the furthest extremity of the
island. The first place of shelter which the beggar saw, he let
the boat in there. The little cove is still known as the Port of
the Galley (<i>Port-na-Birlinn</i>) on the south side of <i>Barradhu</i>
where the present dwellings belonging to the Skerryvore Lighthouse
are. The company landed safely, and on parting the
Lady of Dowart told the beggar man to come to see her at
Island House, where the residence of the Dowart family was at
that time, and which is still the proprietory residence of the
island. The name Island House is derived from its present
site having been formerly surrounded by the water of the fresh-water
lake near it. It communicated with the rest of the island
by means of a draw-bridge, but there being now no necessity
for this safeguard the space between the house and the shore
has been filled up, and the moated grange has become like
ordinary dwelling houses. The stranger wandered about for
some time, and then went to the Island House and was kindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
received. After a day or two, he thought it would be better to
get a house for himself, and the Lady of Dowart said that she
would give him any place that he himself would fix upon.
Apparently the island was not much tenanted then, and
according to the custom of the time, he got a horse with a
pack-saddle on, and on the ridge of the saddle (<i>cairb na
srathrach</i>), he put the upper and lower stones of a quern
(<i>bràthuinn</i>), one on each side of the horse, secured by a
straw, or sea-bent rope, and wherever the rope broke it was
lucky to build the house there. The beggar-man’s quern fell
at Sunny Spot (<i>Grianal</i>), now better known as Greenhill. He
built a bothy there, and a woman came to keep house for him.
By her he had a son, whom he would not acknowledge. When
the child was able to take care of itself she went again to him
with it that she might be free. He still refused to receive the
child and told her to avoid him. She then thought as she had
heard from him before where he came from, that she would
go with her son to his relatives in Ireland. When she arrived
there the child’s grandfather received her very kindly. She
stayed with him till her son had grown to manhood (<i>gus an
robh e ’na làn duine</i>). As she was about to return the grandfather
said to his grandson, “Which do you now prefer, to
follow your mother, or stay with me?” The lad said he would
rather follow his mother, and risk his fortune along with her.
They came back to Tiree again, and the son would give no
rest till they went to see his father. When they reached the
bothy the mother said “you will surely receive your son to-day
though you would not acknowledge him before.” But he would
not any more than at first. His son then took hold of him,
and putting his knee on his breast, said, “before you rise from
there you will own me as your lawful son, and my mother as
your married wife.” He did this and was set free. They then
lived together and built a house, and houses, and increased in
stock of cattle. One wild evening in spring, when they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
folding the cattle, they observed a stout looking man of mean
appearance coming from Kilkenneth, still a township in that
part of the island, and making straight for the house.</p>

<p>“I never saw a bigger man than that beggar,” said the son.</p>

<p>“He is big,” the father said, “I well know what man it is;
he is coming after me, and I will lose my life this night, I
killed his brother, but it was not my fault, for if I had not
killed him, he would have killed me.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will not lose your life to-night yet,” said the
son, “be kind to him, and when he has warmed himself, ask
him to go out with us to kill a cow, for the night is cold.”</p>

<p>The stranger came in and was made welcome. The old man
then said since there was a stranger, and the night chilly, they
better take a cow and kill it. They went out and brought in
the cow. The young man said to the stranger, “Which would
you rather, take the axe, or hold the cow’s horn?” (<i>Co dhiu b’
fhearr leis an tuath na ’n adharc</i>). The stranger chose to hold
the horn, and the blow by which the beast was felled was so
sudden and unexpected that the stranger fell with it. The
youth immediately fell upon him and kept him down, saying,
“You will only have what you can do for yourself, till you tell
why you came here to-night (<i>Cha bhi agad ach na bheir thu g’ a
chionn gus an aidich thu ’de thug so an nochd thu</i>). He told
word for word how he came to avenge his brother’s death.
(<i>Dh’ innis e facal air an fhacal mar thainig e thoirt mach éirig
a bhràthair</i>).</p>

<p>“You will not leave this alive” said the young man, “until
you promise not to molest my father while you remain in the
country.” The stranger vowed, if released he would not
offend anyone. He was allowed to remain and they passed the
night cheerfully and peacefully (<i>gu sona sàmhach</i>). The
stranger returned the way he came. The father and son then
settled together, and are said according to tradition, to have
been the first Browns in Tiree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Another version of the story is, that the first settler in
Greenhill was a Campbell, and that he was the maker of those
underground dwellings (<i>tighean falaich</i>) which still exist on
that farm; curious habitations, which are unlike any building
now in use, and worthy of closer examination by antiquarians.
It is said that there are buildings with similar entrances exposed
by sand blowing and covered with a great depth of earth in
Tra-vi at the distance of two miles or more further south.</p>

<p>There is a precipice on the west side of Kenavara hill called
Mac-a-Bhriuthainn’s leap (<i>Leum Mhic-a-bhriuthainn</i>) which one
of this sept of Browns is said to have jumped across backwards,
and which no one has since jumped either backwards or
forwards. The one who took the jump is said to have been
chased by a wild ox, which pushed him over the hill, and if he
had not been a man of steady eye and limb, the fall would
have ended in sure destruction. The place where he leapt was
a ledge in the face of a precipice where the slightest overbalance
or weakness, would have precipitated him several
hundred feet into a dangerous and deep sea. No trained tightrope
dancer ever required more sureness of eye and limb than
must have been brought into action in this leap.</p>

<p>In the top of the same hill (Kenavara) there is a well,
Briuthainn’s Well (<i>Tobar Mhic-a-Bhriuthainn</i>), which is said
to have its name from the first who came to the island having,
in his wanderings, subsisted on its water and wild water-cress.</p>

</div>


<p>The name Mac-an-Uidhir is not borne by any person now
living, so far as the writer is aware. Like many other names
it may have been changed into MacDonald, or some other
clan-name. When a person changed his name to that of some
other clan, or powerful chief, he was said to accept the name
and clanship (<i>Ainm ’sa chinneadhdas</i>). This name must, at
one time, however, have been common. The ford between
Benbecula and South Uist is called “The ford of the daughter
of Euar” (<i>Faoghail Nic an Uidhir</i>), and Nic-an-Uidhir is also
named by the Lochnell bard as a sister of Headless Stocking
(<i>Cas-a’-Mhogain</i>), a well-known witch, who lived so long ago
as when Ossian the poet was a boy (<i>giullan</i>).</p>

<p>The person of whom the following story is told, lived at
Hynish in the island of Tiree, and had become engaged to a
young woman in the neighbourhood. Between the espousal
and marriage, the engaged couple went with a party of friends
for a sail to Heisker, near Canna. The men of the party went
ashore seal-hunting and one of the young woman’s disappointed
suitors took advantage of the opportunity to get Mac-an-Uidhir
left behind, and coming back to the boat told that the intending
bridegroom had been drowned. By this lie he hoped to
make the bride despair of seeing her intended any more, and
by renewing his own attentions, to get her to consent to accept
himself. She, however, not believing that he was dead, said
that she would marry no one for a year and a day from the
date of his alleged drowning. [Heisker means high rock,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
this one, near the island of Canna, is called the High Rock of
Windlestraws (<i>Heisgeir nan Cuiseag</i>). It has no one living on
it. At the present day a few young cattle are grazed upon it,
and a boat comes for them in spring from Canna, which lies to
the N.E. It is not otherwise visited except once or twice a
year by seal-hunters.]</p>

<p>At first, Mac-an-Uidhir subsisted on birds and fish eaten
raw; after his powder and shot were expended, he had to keep
himself alive upon whelks, or whatever he could get along the
shore, principally whelks. This sort of shellfish is said to
keep a person alive though he should have no other means of
subsistence, till he becomes as black as the shield or wing of
the whelk (<i>co dubh ri sgiath faochaig</i>). The abandoned and
castaway youth lived in this way for three quarters of a year;
but at last he got away from the islet, and for the last three
months of the year was making his way home. He arrived on
the night on which the marriage of his intended to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
unscrupulous rival was to take place. He went to the house
of his foster-mother, who did not know him, his appearance
through his privations having becoming so much changed, and,
he having asked to be allowed to remain for the night, she said
she was alone, and could not let a stranger like him stay. She
also told of the festivities in the neighbourhood, and said that
he had better pass the night there. He asked the occasion of
the festivities: she told him how her foster-son had been
drowned, and supplanted, and that this was the night of his
rival’s marriage, saying, “If they are happy I am sad, another
one being in the place of my foster-son” (<i>Ma tha iadsan
subhach tha mise dubhach dheth, fear eile bhi dol an àite mo
dhalta</i>). She then added, “this time last year, he perished
when he went with a party to hunt seals in Heisker; his
intended vowed that she would not marry for a year, in the
hope of his returning, as she had not been quite satisfied that
he had been drowned, and to-night the time is expired.”
“Let us go” he said, “to see them.”</p>

<p>“You may go,” she replied, “but they are near enough to
me as it is.” He then asked her if she did not recognise him,
and told who he was, but she refused to believe him, saying
her dear child (<i>mo ghràdh</i>) could not be so much altered in the
time. He put the matter out of question by asking if she
would know her own handiwork, and shewing what was left of
the hose (<i>osain</i>) she had given him, to convince her. When
she saw the labour of her own hands (<i>saothair a làmh fhéin</i>),
she joyfully welcomed him, and went with him where the
marriage party were. Those who were there were surprised to
see her arrival, knowing the sad state in which she was at this
time of year, through the loss of her foster-child. They,
however, received the stranger as well as herself with the
utmost kindness. The bride made the remark, when the
stranger turned his back, that he was like Mac an Uidhir but
when his face was towards her he appeared like a stranger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
whom she had never seen before; but that her heart warmed
towards him. The custom was then gone through of the
stranger drinking out of the bride’s glass, and Mac-an-Uidhir
when doing this, slipped a ring into the glass, which, she
immediately recognised as that of her first lover. The whole
matter was then upset, and the party for whom the preparations
were made were dispersed, and the bride followed the fortunes
of her first lover.</p>

<p>Of a song made by the foster-mother to Mac-an-Uidhir,
when he was reported to have been drowned, and was looked
upon as dead, the following verses have been preserved. In
the translation the literal words are given, but no attempt is
made at reducing them to the rhyme which is essential in
English poetry.</p>

<p>There is quite a modern instance, perhaps about the
beginning of this century, of a native of the islet of
Ulva, near Mull, having been driven during a snowstorm
to <i>Heisgeir-nan-Cuiseag</i> (High Rock of Windlestraws) and
passing the winter there alone till he was taken off early in the
following summer. He, too, must have subsisted on whelks
and what he could get along the shore. He was going home
from Tiree.</p>

<p>Anxious to be at home at the New-year O.S., he, with a
companion, left Tiree, and before going far a snowstorm came
on, and the wind increased in violence till they were driven
they did not know where. The companion got benumbed and
died in the boat. It could only be said by the survivor that
they passed very high rocks on some island.</p>

<p>The boat was cast ashore on Heisker, and the poor man
left in it had to pass the winter as best he could, without food
or shelter.</p>

<p>The islet is too distant from Canna for him to have been
observed by any signal he could make.</p>

</div>


<p>There is an expression in Gaelic “It is time to steep the
withies” (“<i>Tha ’n t-àm bhi bogadh nan gad</i>”), meaning, it is
time for one to leave or make his escape from the company he
is in. This expression is said to have arisen in this way. A
little undersized man and good archer was sitting on a stool by
his own fireside, when enemies intent on securing his person
came in to the house. He sat quietly, but his wife going backwards
and forwards through the house, and being ready-witted,
when she understood the character of the intruders, gave a slap
on the ear to her husband saying, as if he were merely the herd
boy, “It is time to steep the withies” (“<i>Tha ’n t-àm bhi bogadh
nan gad</i>”). He immediately left the house, and she managed
to put his bow and arrows out at the window. He having
stationed himself in a favourable locality did not allow a single
one of his enemies to leave the house without killing them with
his arrows, one by one as they came out at the door. Regarding
the truth of this story it is noticeable, that uniformly throughout
the Highlands the expression, “It is time to steep the withies”
(“<i>Tha ’n t-àm bhi bogadh nan gad</i>”), means, not that it is time
to prepare for action, but that it is time for one to make himself
scarce. A story of the same kind is told of King Alfred
the Great, that he escaped from his enemies in somewhat the
same way. In olden times the harnessing of animals for
carrying burdens, ploughing, etc., was done by means of
withies made of willow, sea-bent,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> or other accessible material,
iron being scarce and difficult to procure, and these withies had
to be steeped before work with them was commenced. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
required a good deal of acquaintance with the work before the
horse was fully equipped with pack-saddle, creels, and other
equipments for which withies were necessary, and the only
means available. The names of some of these withies still
survive <i>e. g.</i> the <i>Gad-tarraich</i> is the Gaelic name still in use,
although the material is leather, and not withies, to denote a
belly-band.</p>

<p class="p1_5">This doughty little archer was attached to the family of the
MacLachlans of <i>Coruanain</i>, or little Lamb-dell, near Fort-William,
on the borders of Inverness-shire and Argyleshire.
He derived his name from his carrying a white bag of arrows,
which he was very skilful in the use of. In far off and
unsettled times, when a foray or <i>creach</i> was being taken from
<i>Coruanain</i>, one of the raiders, having met little John, said,
“Little John of the White Bag, I will mount the hill side
quicker than you” (<i>Iain bhig a’ Bhuilg Bhàin, bheir mise am
fireach dhiot</i>). In a struggle it is always an advantage, even
when other things are even, to have the higher position on a
hill side. Little John replied, “The hand of your father
and grandfather be over you, White Stirk, I will put the
Brankes (or Iron Gag) on you (”<i>Làmh d’ athair ’s do sheanair
ort, a Ghamhain Bhàin cuiridh mise biorach ort</i>“). The
<i>biorach</i>, branker, was a spiked iron gag, or instrument set with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
pointed iron pins, fixed round the head of calves to keep them
from sucking. The expression “The hand, &amp;c., be over you”
was a common expression, meaning much the same as the
English “Look out,” or “Take care of yourself.” Saying
this, Little John let fly an arrow which struck the other in the
forehead, toppled him over, and put an end to the discussion.</p>

<p class="p1_5">In Ardnamurchan, where the district of Kintra commences,
there is a streamlet that falls into Loch-Moidart, which lies
along the north of Ardnamurchan, called <i>Faoghail Dhòmhnuill
Chonalaich</i>. This streamlet derives its name from Donald
MacDonald, or MacConnell, having been slain there under
the following circumstances. Tradition is uniform as to the
incident which gave its name to the place, and as to the
circumstances under which the murder was committed.
Donald was the heir to the chieftainship of Ardnamurchan,
but his uncle, Big Angus, wishing to secure the estate for
himself, waylaid his nephew at the ford mentioned, which is
very difficult to jump across when the tide is in, as he was on
his way to be married to a daughter of the then Chief of
Lochiel. While Donald was jumping across the ford, one of
Big Angus’s men shot an arrow in his face, so that when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
touched the ground on the other side, he staggered and reeled.
Before he fell prostrate Big Angus said that he would wonder
if his nephew would dance as merrily at his marriage with the
daughter of the One-eyed Chief of meat-broth (<i>saoil an dannsadh
tu co cridheil sin air banais nighean Cham-na-eanraich</i>). The
meaning of this nick-name given to the Chief of Lochiel is
a covert allusion to the cattle-lifting of Lochiel. Before the
introduction of tea, extract of meat was largely made use of,
and even meal was mixed with it for those in strong health,
but weak, and even chicken broth, was given to those who
were in delicate health. Some say that the Chief referred
to was <i>Ailein nan Creach</i> (Allan the Cattle-lifter), who
derived his name from the number of cattle-spoils that
he lifted. Lochaber being a wild and remote district was
not unnaturally a place to which cattle forays were taken when
people sought “the beeves that made the broth” in other
localities.</p>

<p>In Gregory’s History of the Western Islands <i>Dòmhnull
Conalach</i> is called John, probably from the Chiefs of Ardnamurchan
being known as Mac-’ic-Iain, the son of the son of
John, and mention is made of his murder. Several families
who have in recent times come to Coll from Ardnamurchan
call themselves Johnstones.</p>

<p>Big Angus himself had a house near Strontian strongly
fortified according to the ideas of those days. It was surrounded
by a deep ditch (<i>Tigh daingean dige</i>) and what is now called a
moated Grange. On hearing that Lochiel with a strong band
of followers was on his way to avenge the death of the young
Chief of Ardnamurchan, Big Angus fled, but he was closely
pursued by the avengers. Having come to Cor-ospuinn in
Morven he looked behind him, when the sun was rising, to see
if his pursuers were coming. Lifting his helmet and shading
his eyes with his hand when looking intently sunwards, one of
the pursuers, a little man, remarked, “Would not this be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
good opportunity for killing him?” Another answered, “It
is not your trifling hand that would slay the powerful man.”
(<i>Cha ’n i do làmh leibideach a leagadh an duine foghainteach</i>).
The little man replied, “Would not an arrow do it” (<i>Nach
deanadh saighead e</i>), saying this, he launched an arrow which
struck Big Angus in the forehead and killed him.</p>

BIG ANGUS OF ARDNAMURCHAN.<br />
(<i>Aonghas mór Mac ’ic Eoin</i>)</h4>

<div class="mr10 ml10">

<p class="p1_5">The incidents of this story occurred about 1596. The house of the
redoubtable Angus was at <i>Ath na h-éilde</i> (Ford of the Hind (deer)),
opposite <i>Druim-nan-torran</i> (The Ridge of Knolls), near <i>Sròn an
t-sìthean</i>, Strontian, the Promontory of the Fairy Dwelling. He had
a bad wife, who was continually urging him to make himself Chief of
the clan, and it was at her instigation that he waylaid his nephew at
Kintra. On hearing that the Chief was to be married to the daughter
of Lochiel, his wife warned big Angus that he would yet be reduced
to draw the peat creels (<i>tarruing nan cliabh mòine</i>) for his nephew.
Angus was the first to be at Kintra, at the river, and the first to
cross. The guests were assembled at Lochiel for the marriage of
Donald MacDonald, when word was brought of his having been
slain. Immediately the assembled guests with their followers set off
to take vengeance, and, finding Big Angus’s house deserted, they
tied tinder (<i>spong</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>) to an arrow and set the moated house on fire.
The place where Angus was slain in Morven is still called <i>Leac na
Saighead</i> (The Ledge of the Arrow), and the archer was <i>Iain Dubh
Beag Innse-ruith</i> (Little Black John of Inch-rui). Big Dugald MacDonald
(<i>Dughal mòr MacRaonuil</i>), of Morar had his hand similarly
fastened by an arrow to his forehead.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_LAST_CATTLE_RAID_IN_TIREE">THE LAST CATTLE RAID IN TIREE.</h3>
</div>


<p>It seems to have been a kind of raid or robbery to which the
island of Tiree was particularly liable. Plunderers and pirates,
having chosen a suitable day when the seas about the island
were at rest, and the cattle could be easily got on board the
galley, or <i>birlinn</i>, carried on depredations far and wide on the
island. Once the cattle were got by them on board the galley,
they looked upon themselves as safe from pursuit.</p>

<p>There are two traditions in existence of the island having
been so visited, and their fate will illustrate the manner in
which, in unsettled times, such expeditions were conducted.
The last foray of the kind was not successful, but the cattle
and sheep were collected for taking away. The people got
warning in time, and the cattle-lifters had to make their escape,
leaving their booty behind them.</p>

<p>The last successful foray was in the days of the Tanister
of Torloisk, and seems to have been only sometime previous
to or about the ’45. The account which tradition gives of it is
that the Tanister, or second heir (<i>proximus haeres</i>), of Torloisk
in Mull was called Malise MacLean. His first name is somewhat
peculiar, and not common among the MacLeans or any
other West Highland clan, and was given to him in this manner.
The heir of Torloisk was a promising healthy boy, but the
succeeding children of the then chief were dying young. The
Chief was then advised by the sages of his race to give to his
child the name of the first person whom he met on the way to
have the child baptized. The first person encountered was a
poor beggar man who had the name of Malise. A name given
in this way was known as <i>ainm rathaid</i>, or road name, and was
deemed as proof against evil. The father gave this name to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the child who survived and became Tanister. Being without
the prospect of an estate the Tanister thought he would come
to Tiree, and piece by piece get an estate for himself. He
came to have the half, third, or other share of the town-ship of
<i>Baile-meadhonach</i>, now called Middleton, in Tiree, and married,
and his descendants are still known.</p>

<p>One day, a galley, with sixteen men on board (<i>Bìrlinn ’s sea
fir dheug</i>), came to Soraba beach. The men landed and collected
every live animal that was about the place. At the time, the
Tanister happened to be fishing at the rocks in Kenavara Hill,
and on coming home soon after and hearing what had been
done, he called to his neighbours asking them what they meant
to do, were they going with him to turn the raid (<i>creach</i>). They
all refused for fear of being killed, as the freebooters were a
strong party. He said, “I will not do that; I prefer to fall in
the attempt (<i>tuiteam ’s an oidhirp</i>), rather than let my cattle
be taken.” He took with him his sword and followed the
spoilers. When he came to the end of the pathway and within
sight of the galley, he stood before the creach. The freebooters
told him to leave the road or he would feel the consequences
(<i>Gu ’m biodh a’ bhuil dha</i>). He answered, “I will not leave, and the
consequences will be to you, until I get my own.” He got this
as he seemed determined, and when he had got it, he asked also
the cow of a poor woman from the same township as himself, and
having got this also, he said they might do with the rest what they
liked. The plan of the robbers was to drive the cattle to the
beach, where the galley was, and throwing them down and
tying their forelegs together (<i>ceangal nan ceithir chaoil</i>), place
them on bearers, or planks, and put them in the boat. When
they had done so, they made off, and no one knew whence
they had come or whither they went. This was the last
successful raid of the kind raised in Tiree.</p>

<p>Subsequent to this creach, and in the time of Mr. Charles
Campbell being Minister of Tiree, several galleys, or <i>bìrlinnean</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
each with its complement of men, and in addition each with a
pretending minister and his man, made their appearance on the
coast of Tiree. In those days every minister took his man
along with him, and in this case each minister but one took his
man from the boat. Wandering open-air preachers were in
those times called hillock ministers (<i>ministearan nan cnoc</i>), and
the one to whom the story refers was to officiate at <i>Ceathramh
Mhurdat</i>, or Fourth Part, called Murdat, now embraced in the
farm of Hough,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and which was then thickly populated. Having
sent due intimation round of his service, most of the people
were drawn to hear him. His man was left behind to give
him warning of any disturbance of the expedition which might
occur. After he had been speaking for some time his man
came in. The islanders had become aware of the nature of
the invasion. The sheep and the horses were gathered at
the back of the hill of Hough, and a band of the cattle-lifters
had surrounded them for to drive them to the
shore. A number who had not got to the preaching had
observed this, and following them, took the sheep and horses
from them. Immediately, the minister’s man ran with all
possible speed to warn the preacher at Murdat. When he
came to where the sermon was, the preacher concluded, and
handing the book to his man, venturing to think that the
people would not understand him, said, as if reading a line,
“MacLellan, beloved friend, where did you leave the <i>Shockum
sho?</i>”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the booty. (<i>Mhac-’ill-fhaolain, a dhuine ghaolaich,
c’ àite an d’ fhàg thu an ’seogam seoth’?</i>). The incomer
taking the book, and as if intoning the psalm, said, “Matters
are worse than we thought; they have taken from us the
plaintive bleaters” (<i>’s miosa tha na mar a shaoil: thug iad
uainn an ’cirri-mèh’</i>): <i>cirri-mèh</i> is but an imitation of the
bleating of sheep, and is found used in different localities as a
pet or ludicrous name for sheep.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>
<p>The people sang along with the precentor. They did not
know but that the words may have been part of the psalm,
when one who was smarter and more ready-witted than the
rest got up and said, “We have been long enough here, these
men are robbers, and not ministers.” The service was concluded,
the people going to look after their cattle, and the
minister and his man making their way with all speed to where
the galleys lay. Before the people could overtake them, they
got on board and made off, leaving their booty behind, and
glad to escape with their lives.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="LOCHBUIES_TWO_HERDSMEN">LOCHBUIE’S TWO HERDSMEN.</h3>
</div>


<p>This tale was written down as it was told by Donald Cameron,
Rùdhaig, Tiree, more than twenty-five years ago, and to whose
happy and retentive gift of memory it is a pleasure to recur.
He had a most extensive stock of old lore, and along with it
much readiness and willingness to communicate what he knew.
In this the ludicrous element is natural, and the events seem to
follow each other as a matter of course, so that the tale, so far
as probability is concerned, may be true enough. It is one of
the few tales to which a date is attached, and so far as history
can be consulted the state of the country at that time makes
it probable enough. Loch Buie is a district lying to the South
of the Island of Mull, pleasantly situated. The tale runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>In 1602 Lochbuie had two herdsmen, and the wife of one
herdsman went to the house of the other herdsman. The
housewife was in before her, and had a pot on the fire. “What
have you in the pot?” said the one who came in. “Well there
it is,” she said, “a drop of <i>brochan</i> which the goodman will
have with his dinner.”</p>

<p>“What kind of <i>brochan</i> is it?” said the one who came in.</p>

<p>“It is <i>dubh-bhrochan</i>,”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> said the one who was in.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he,” said she, “a poor man! Are you not giving him
anything but that? I have been for so long a time under the
Laird of Loch Buie, and I have not drank <i>brochan</i> without a
grain of beef or something in it. Don’t you think it is but a
small thing for the Laird of Loch Buie though we should get an
ox every year. Little he would miss it. I will send over my
husband to-night, and you will bring home one of the oxen.”</p>

<p>When night came she sent him over. The wife then sent
the other away. The one said, “you will steal the ox from the
fold, and you will bring it to me, and we will be free; I will
swear that I did not take it from the fold, and you will swear
that you did not take it home.”</p>

<p>The two herdsmen went away. In those days they hanged
a man, when he did harm, without waiting for law or sentence,
and at this time Lochbuie had hanged a man in the wood.
The herdsmen went and kindled a fire near a tree in the wood
as a signal to the one who went to steal. One sat at the fire,
and the other went to steal the ox.</p>

<p>The same night a number of gentlemen were in the mansion<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
at Loch Buie. They began laying wagers with Lochbuie that
there was not one in the house who would take the shoe off the
man who had been hanged that day. Lochbuie laid a wager
that there was. He called up his big lad MacFadyen,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and said to him was he going to let the wager go against
him. The big lad asked what the wager was about. He said
to him that they were maintaining that there was no one in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
court who could take the shoe off the one who had been hanged
that day. MacFadyen said he would take off him the shoe and
bring it to them where they were.</p>

<p>MacFadyen went on his way. When he reached, he looked
and saw the man who had been hanged warming himself at a
fire. He did not go farther on, but returned in haste. When
he came they asked him if he had the shoe. He told them he
had not, for that yon one was with a withy basket of peats
before him, warming himself. “We knew ourselves,” said the
gentlemen, “that you had only cowards.”</p>

<p>The lameter, who was over, said, “It is a wrong thing you
are doing in allowing him to lose the wager. If I had the use
of my feet, I would go and take his leg off as well as his shoe
before I would let Lochbuie lose the wager.”</p>

<p>“Come you here,” said the big lad, “and I will put a pair of
feet that you never had the like of under you.” He put the
lameter round his neck (lit. the bone of his neck), and off he
went. When they came in sight of the man who was warming
himself the lameter sought to return. MacFadyen said they
would not return. They went nearer to the man who was
warming himself. The one that was at the fire lifted his head
and observed them coming. He thought it was his own
companion, the one who had gone to steal the ox, who was
come. He spoke and said, “Have you come?” “I have,”
said MacFadyen. “And have you got it?” “Yes,” said MacFadyen.
“And is it fat?”</p>

<p>“Whether he is fat or lean, there he is to you,” and he threw
the lameter on to the fire.</p>

<p>MacFadyen took to his heels (lit. put on soles) and fled as
fast as ever he did. Off went the lameter after him. He put
the four oars on for making his escape. The one at the fire
rose, thinking there were some who had come to pry upon
himself, and that he was now caught. He went after the
lameter to make his excuses to the Laird of Loch Buie. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
lameter was observing him coming after him, feeling quite sure
that it was the one who had been hanged.</p>

<p>MacFadyen reached, and they asked him if he had taken the
shoe off the man. He said they did not; that he asked him if
the lameter was fat, and that he was sure he had him eaten up
before now. The lameter came, and that cry in his head for
to let him in, for that yon one was coming. He was let in.
The moment this was done, the one who had been on the gallows
knocked at the door, to let him in. Lochbuie said he would
not.</p>

<div class="blockquot bbox">

<p class="center">Editor’s Note:</p>

<p>The translation of lines 6 and 7 renders the Gaelic idiom
exactly. Translated more freely into English it would run,
“and the lameter came, and with yon terrified cry demanded
admittance, saying that the hanged man was coming after him.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I am your own herdsman.” They now let him in. He
then began to tell how he and the other herdsman went to
steal the ox, and that he thought it was the other herdsman
who had returned, and it was that made him ask if he was fat.
Lochbuie and his guests had much sport and merriment over
this all night. They kept the herdsman till it was late on in
the night telling them how it happened to him.</p>

<p>The one who went to steal the ox now came back and
reached the tree where he left the other herdsman, but found
no one. He began to search up and down, and became
aware of the one dangling from the tree.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said he, “you have been hanged since I went away,
and I will be to-morrow in the same plight that you are in. It
has been an ill-guided object, and the tempting of women that
sent us on the journey.”</p>

<p>He then went over and took the man off the tree to take him
home. He went away with him and never got the like, going
through hill, and through mud and dirt, till he came to the
house of the other woman. He knocked at the door. The
wife rose and let him in.</p>

<p>“How have things happened with you?” “Never you mind,
whatever; but, alas! he has been hanged since we went away.”</p>

<p>The wife took to roaring and crying.</p>

<p>“Do not say a word,” he said, “or else you and I will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
hanged to-morrow. We will bury him in the garden, and no
one will ever know about it. And now,” he said, “I will be
returning to my own house.”</p>

<p>The one that was in Loch Buie thought it was time for him
now to go home. He knocked at his own door. His wife did
not say a word. He then called out to be let in.</p>

<p>“I will not,” said the wife, “for you have been hanged, and
you will never get in here.”</p>

<p>“I have not yet been hanged,” he said.</p>

<p>“Be that as it may to you,” she said, “you will never come
here.”</p>

<p>The advice he gave himself was to go to the house of the
other herdsman. He called out at that one’s door to let him in.</p>

<p>“You will not come in here. I got enough carrying you
home on my back, and you after being hanged.”</p>

<p>There was a large window at the end of the house. He went
in at the window. “Get up,” he said, “and get a light, and
you will see that I have not been hanged any more than yourself.”
When he saw who he had, he kept him till morning,
till day came. They then talked together, telling each other
what had happened to them on both sides, and thought they
would go to Lochbuie, and tell him all that occurred to them.
When Lochbuie heard their story, there was not a year after
that but he gave each of them an ox and a boll of meal.</p>

<p>Ann an 1602 bha dà bhuachaille aig Lochabuidhe, ’s thàinig
bean an darna buachaille gu tigh a’ bhuachaille eile; agus bean-an-tighe
stigh roimpe ’s poit aice air teine; “Dé th’ agaibh anns
a’ phòit?” ars’ an té a thàinig a stigh. “Ma ta,” ars’ ise, “deur
de bhrochan a bhios aig an duine le ’dhìnneir,” “’Dé,” ars’ an
té a thàinig a stigh, “an seòrsa brochain a th’ ann?” “Tha,”
ars’ an té a bha stigh, “dubh-bhrochan.”<a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> “Nach esan,” ars’
ise, “an duine truagh? Nach ’eil thu ’toirt da dad ach sin?
Tha mise an uiread so de ùine fuidh thighearna Lochabuidhe,
’s cha d’ òl mi brochan gun fhionnan-feòla no rud-eiginn ann.
Saoil nach beag do thighearna Lochabuidhe, ged a gheibheamaide
damh ’s a’ bhliadhna; nach beag a dh’ ionndrainneadh e
e? Cuiridh mise an duine agam fhéin a nall an nochd ’s bheir
sibh dhachaigh fear de na daimh.”</p>

<p>’N uair thàinig an oidhche chuir i nall e. Chuir a’ bhean an
so air falbh an duin’ eile. Thuirt an darna fear, “Goididh tusa
an damh thar na buaile, ’s bheir thu thugamsa e, agus bithidh
sinn saor; mionnaichidh mise nach d’ thug mi thar na buaile e,
’s mionnaichidh tusa nach d’ thug thu dhachaigh e.”</p>

<p>Dh’ fhalbh an dà bhuachaille. ’S an àm sin chrochadh iad
duine tra ’dheanadh e cron, gun fheitheamh ri lagh no binn;
ach anns na lathan bha tighearna Lochabuidhe an déigh duine
’chrochadh stigh ’s a’ choille. Dh’ fhalbh iadsan ’s dh’ fhadaidh
iad teine aig craoibh ’s a’ choille, mar chomharradh do ’n fhear
a chaidh a ghoid. Shuidh fear aig an teine ’s chaidh am fear
eile a ghoid an daimh. Air an oidhche fhéin bha mòran de
dhaoin’-uaisle ’s a’ Mheigh<a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> aig tighearna Lochabuidhe. Bhuail
iad air cur gheall ri tighearna Lochabuidhe nach robh duine ’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
an tigh aige a bheireadh a’ bhròg thar an fhir a chaidh chrochadh
an diugh. Chuir tighearna Lochabuidhe geall riù-san gu ’n
robh. Ghlaodh e nuas air a ghille mhòr Mac Phaidean.<a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Thuirt
e ris an robh e brath an geall a leigeadh air. Dh’ fharraid an
gille mòr c’ ar son a bha ’n geall. Thuirt e ris, gu ’n robh iad
ag ràdh nach robh duine ’n a chùirt a bheireadh a’ bhròg thar
an fhir a chaidh chrochadh an diugh. Thuirt Mac Phaidean
gu ’n tugadh esan dheth a’ bhròg ’s gu ’n tugadh e thuga ann an
sud i.</p>

<p>Dh’ fhalbh Mac Phaidean air a thurus. ’Nuair a ràinig e
sheall e ’s chunnaic e ’m fear a chaidh chrochadh ’deanamh a
gharaidh. Cha deach e na b’ fhaid’ air aghaidh, ’s thill e le
cabhaig. ’Nuair a ràinig e thuirt iad ris, an robh a’ bhròg aige.
Thuirt e riu nach robh, gur h-ann a bha ’m fear ud ’s làn cléibh
de mhòine air a bhialthaobh ’s e ’deanamh a gharaidh. “Dh’
aithnich sinn-fhéin,” ars’ na daoin’-uaisle, “nach robh agad ach
an gealtair.” Thuirt an clàraineach<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> a bha thall, “Is ceàrr an
rud a tha thu ’deanamh, an geall a leigeadh air; na ’m biodh
comas nan cas agam-fhéin dh’ fhalbhainn ’s bheirinn a’ chas
dheth co math ris a’ bhròig mu ’n leiginn an geall air tighearna
Lochabuidhe!”</p>

<p>“Thig thusa so,” ars’ an gille mòr, “’s cuiridh mise dà chois
nach deachaidh riamh ’n leithid ortsa fothad.” Chuir e ’n clàraineach
mu chnàimh ’amhaich, ’s dh’ fhalbh e leis. ’Nuair
thainig iad ’an sealladh an duine a bha ’deanamh a gharaidh, dh’
iarr an clàraineach tilleadh. Thuirt Mac Phaidean nach tilleadh.
Dhlùthaich iad ris an fhear a bha ’deanamh a gharaidh. Thog
am fear a bha aig an teine a cheann, ’s mhothaich e dhoibh-san
a’ tighinn. Shaoil leis gur h-e a chompanach fhéin, am fear
a chaidh a ghoid an daimh, a bha air tighinn. Labhair e ’s

“’S am bheil e agad?” “Tha,” ars’ Mac Phaidean. “’S am
bheil e reamhar?” “Biodh e reamhar no caol agad, sin agad
e!” ’s e a’ tilgeadh a’ chlàraineich mu ’n teine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Chuir Mac Phaidean na buinn air, ’s theich e co làidir ’s a
rinn e riamh. Leum an clàraineach air falbh as a dhéighinn,
chuir e na ceithir raimh<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> orra gu teicheadh. Dh’ éirich am fear
a bh’ aig an teine, agus dùil aige gur h-e feadhainn a thainig a
dh’ fharcluais air fhéin a bh’ ann, ’s gu ’n robh e nis a sàs.
Dh’ fhalbh e as déighinn a’ chlàraineach, dhol a ghabhail a
leithsgeul do thighearna Lochabuidhe. Bha an clàraineach
’g a fhaicinn a’ tighinn as a dhéighinn, ’s e làn-chinnteach gur
h-e ’m fear a chaidh chrochadh a bh’ ann.</p>

<p>Ràinig Mac Phaidean. Dh’ fharraid iad dheth an d’ thug
iad bròg bharr an duine. Thuirt e nach d’ thug, gu ’n dubhairt
e ris-san an robh an clàraineach reamhar, ’s gu ’n robh e cinnteach
gu ’n robh e air ’itheadh aca roimhe so.</p>

<p>Ràinig an clàraineach ’s an glaodh ud ’n a cheann, esan a
leigeadh a stigh, gu ’n robh am fear ud a’ tighinn. Leigeadh a
stigh e. Am buileach a bha e stigh, bhuail am fear a bh’ air
a’ chroich ’s an dorus, esan a leigeadh a stigh. Thuirt fear
Lochabuidhe nach leigeadh. “Is ann a th’ annam,” ars’ esan,
“am buachaille agaibh fhéin.” Leig iad ’an so a stigh e.
Bhuail e so air innseadh dhoibh mar chaidh e-fhéin ’s am
buachaille eile a ghoid an daimh; gu ’n do shaoil esan gur h-e ’m
buachaille eile a bha air tilleadh leis an damh, gur h-e ’thug air
a dh’ fheòraich an robh e reamhar. Bha spòrs is fearas-chuideachd
anabarrach aig tighearna Lochabuidhe ’s aig ’uaislean air
a so fad na h-oidhche. Chum iad aca am buachaille gus an
robh e ro-fhada dh’ oidhche ’g innseadh naigheachd mar a
dh’ éirich dha.</p>

<p>Thàinig so am fear a chaidh a ghoid an daimh. Ràinig e
’chraobh aig an d’ fhàg e ’m buachaille eile ’s cha d’ fhuair e
duine. Bhuail e air siubhal sìos ’s suas; mhothaich e ’n slaod
ud nuas ris a’ chraoibh. “O,” ars’ esan, “tha thusa air do
chrochadh bho ’n a dh’ fhalbh mise, ’s bithidh mise am maireach
air an ruith air am bheil thu fhéin. ’S e an turus mi-shealbhach,
’s buaireadh nam ban, a chuir sinne air an turus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Ghabh e null ’s thug e’ n duine bhàrr na croiche g’ a thoirt
dachaigh. Dh’ fhalbh e ’s cha d’ fhuair e leithid dol roimh
mhonadh ’s roimh pholl ’s roimh eabar riamh; mu dheireadh
ràinig e tigh na mnatha bha ’n duine air a chrochadh aice.
Bhuail e ’s an dorus; dh’ éirich a’ bhean ’s leig i stigh e.
“Ciamar a dh’ éirich dhuibh?” ars’ a’ bhean. “Is coma leatsa
co-dhiù, mo thruaighe! tha e air a chrochadh o ’n a dh’ fhalbh
sinn.”</p>

<p>Chaidh a’ bhean gu glaodhaich agus gu caoineadh. “Na
abair guth,” ars’ esan, “air neo bithidh tu fhéin ’s mise air ar
crochadh am màireach. Tiodhlaicidh sinn anns a’ ghàradh e,
’s cha bhi fios aig duine am feasd air. Nis (ars’ esan), bithidh
mise falbh dhachaigh thun mo thighe féin.”</p>

<p>Ach smaointich am fear a bha ’n Lochbuidhe gu ’n robh an
t-àm aige tighinn dachaigh nis. Bhuail e ’s an dorus aige fhéin.
Cha dubhairt a bhean guth. Ghlaodh e so a leigeadh a stigh.
“Cha leig,” ars’ a bhean, “’s ann a tha thu air do chrochadh;
cha tig thu so am feasd!”</p>

<p>“Cha ’n ’eil mi air mo chrochadh fhathast,” thuirt esan.</p>

<p>“Biodh sin mar a dh’ fheudas e dhuit,” ars’ ise, “cha ’n
fhaigh thu stigh so am feasd.”</p>

<p>Is e ’chomhairle a smaointich e air, dol gu tigh a’ bhuachaille
eile. Ghlaodh e ’s an dorus aig an fhear ud, a leigeil a
stigh. Thuirt am fear ud, “Cha tig thu stigh an so; fhuair
mise gu leòir ’g ad thoirt dachaigh air mo mhuin ’s tu air do
chrochadh.” Bha uinneag mhòr air ceann an tighe ’s ghabh e
dh’ ionnsuidh na h-uinneig. Thàinig e stigh air an uinneig.
“Eirich,” ars’ esan, “’s las solus ’s gu ’m faic thu nach do
chrochadh mise na ’s mò na ’chrochadh tu-fhéin.”</p>

<p>’Nuair chunnaic e gur e a bh’ aige, chum e aige e gu maduinn,
gus an d’ thàinig an latha. Chuir iad an so an guth ri chéile a
dh’ innseadh dhaibh mar a dh’ éirich dhaibh thall ’s a bhos;
gu ’n rachadh iad gu tighearna Lochabuidhe ’s gu ’n innseadh

tighearna Lochabuidhe mar a dh’ éirich doibh, cha robh bliadhna
tuilleadh nach tugadh e damh do na h-uile fear dhiubh, ’s bolla

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> <i>Dubh-bhrochan</i> is a thin mixture of oatmeal and water, without
meat or vegetables. This seems to have been a popular drink in
olden times. When the Lord of the Isles kept state at Duntulm
Castle in Skye, no one was admitted into the potentate’s body-guard
unless he could take the vessel (diorcal), containing the liquid, with
one hand from his companion, take his own mouthful, and pass it on
to the next. In the Island of Mull, adjoining the Sound, and opposite
Ardtornish, once the seat of the Lords of the Isles, there is a place,
probably deriving its name from some fancied resemblance to this
dish, called Loch Diorcal.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="MAC_NEIL_OF_BARRA_AND_THE_LOCHLINNERS">MAC NEIL OF BARRA, AND THE LOCHLINNERS.</h3>
</div>


<p>The Lochlinners came to Barra at one time and they put
Mac Neil to flight. He escaped to Ireland, where he remained.
When his sons grew up, they heard themselves continually
twitted as strangers, and called “Barraich.” They resolved to
find out the reason of this treatment, and one day, while at
dinner, they demanded from their father an explanation of
their being called by such an uncommon name as “Barraich”
(Barraidhich); but he replied that the mention of that name
caused him the deepest sorrow, and forbade them ever to
mention it in his hearing again. “We will never eat a bite nor
drink a drink again,” they said, “till we know what the word
means.” He then explained the name and told them all that
happened to him and how he had to suffer indignity and scorn
as long as his powerful enemies the Norsemen held his lands.
His sons on hearing the cause of their father’s banishment
resolved to try every means in their power to recover their inheritance.
They began to fit out a galley (<i>bìrlinn</i>), and when
it was completed with masts, sails, oars, crew and compass, and
in readiness to go away, their father gave them the point to
Barra Head, and said, that if the man he left at Barra was still
there, and whose name was Macillcary (Mac’ille-charaich), he
would direct them straight to the place where they were to go
to in search of their enemies. Thus it happened (<i>’s ann mar
sin a bhà</i>). They found the man and told him who they were
and the purpose for which they came. He bade them steer for
Castle Bay (<i>Bàigh-a’-chaisteil</i>) and a light on the right-hand-side
as they entered. They reached the house where the light was,
but could get no entrance. They climbed to the roof, and
looking through an opening saw a poor old man who was weeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
bitterly. They called to him that they were friends, and on
admitting them he told them how that day he had been paying his
rent to the Lochlinners and wanted a few marks of it, for this
they threatened him that if he did not return with the balance
of the rent, he would receive next day at noon a certain number
of lashes. The Mac Neils then told their errand, and the old
man joyfully showed them the most direct and secret way to
the Castle, in which was a well of pure water whose source was
unknown. They took the castle, and went on to Kinloch
(Ceannloch), and cleared Vaslam as well. They then sent word
to their father, who came with a band of followers to their help,
and others, native born, whom he had formerly known, and on
whose friendship he could rely, as soon as the tidings of his
return reached them, joined his band. An unacknowledged
son whom he had left, came among the rest to his assistance.
This son, from the circumstance, was known as Mac-an-amharuis
(the son of doubt). When he put forward his claim, Mac
Neil replied, “If you are a son of mine, prove it by clearing
Eilean Fiaradh, before morning, of my enemies.” “Give me
the means then,” Mac-an-amharuis answered, “and I will not
leave the blood of one of the race in any part or place (<i>’s cha’n
fhàg mi fuil fìneig dhiubh ’an àite na’n ionad</i>).” Mac Neil
gave him his own sword, and that night while the Lochlinners,
who had been carousing heavily, slept soundly, he made his
way and got secretly in to the castle which stands on an inlet
before Eoligarry castle, eight miles from Castle Bay, and killed
the inmates where they lay. It is said that their bodies are still
to be seen when a violent storm drifts the sand hither and
thither over the fort (<i>tigh-dìon</i>) where they were slain. From
that day Mac Neil had his own rights.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="FINLAY_GUIVNAC">FINLAY GUIVNAC.</h3>
</div>


<p>At the time MacLean of Dowart was proprietor of Tiree, this
man, <i>Fionnladh Guibhneach</i>, was living near a small bay, <i>Port-nan-long</i>,
in Balemartin, on the south side of the island
(<i>air an leige deas</i>). There was no other joinersmith but
himself, or rather, there was none to equal him in skill in the
five islands (<i>anns na còig eileanan</i>). Balemartin and Mannal
were in those days one farm-holding, and there were few people
in the township. The change-house (<i>tigh-òsd</i>) was at the streamlet
Gedans (<i>amhuinn Ghoidean</i>), between Island House, the
proprietor’s residence, and the shore. At this time, also, there
was fosterhood (<i>comhaltas</i>) between MacLeod of Dunvegan and
MacLean of Tiree, by which they were bound to give proof of
friendship for each other at whatever cost or whenever there
was occasion on either side, and MacLeod, being in need of
Finlay Guivnac’s service, came with his boat (<i>bìrlinn</i>) to Tiree
for him. He landed at <i>Port-nan-long</i> (the creek of sailing
ships), and on reaching Island House was heartily welcomed
by MacLean. When he asked for Finlay, he was told that
he had not been at Island House for some days, “and it
is not a good day when I do not see him,” MacLean
said. MacLeod said he came to take Finlay with him
for a year’s service; that all care would be taken of
him, and if no misfortune or mischance befell either of them,
he himself would bring him home at the end of the year. When
MacLean heard this he said they would go in search of Finlay.
They went, and as they were crossing the common (<i>an clar
macharach</i>), between the house and the streamlet, they met
Finlay, who, having recovered from the attack of ill-humour,
was, as was usually his daily custom, on his way to Island
House. MacLeod asked after his health, and if he was yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
able to do as good work as ever. Finlay said that in place of
getting weaker as he got older, he was daily gaining in strength
and vigour (<i>neart’s tàbhachd</i>); he was more active in walking,
and could see better than he had ever done. MacLeod said
he was surprised to hear that, as in Skye people were failing in
strength and activity as they became older, “and it is curious
that it is different with you.” Finlay said he knew he was
better now at walking and was gaining his eyesight, as formerly
he could jump over Sorabai stream, but now he walked to the
ford to get across; and when he was younger, if he saw a
person, it was as one, but now it was as two and three. They
took Finlay with them to the change-house. When pledging
MacLean’s health, MacLeod, as was customary, said, “Wishing
to get my wish from you, MacLean” (<i>Mo shainnseal ort, Mhic’illeathain</i>).</p>


<p>“You are welcome to have your wish freely gratified” (<i>’S e
beatha le sainnseal</i>),<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> MacLean replied. “My wish is that I may
get Finlay with me,” MacLeod said. In returning the compliment
MacLean said, “My wish is that I may keep Finlay to
myself.” “But I do not ask to keep him always,” MacLeod
said. They then settled the wages, and agreed between them
that Finlay should go to Dunvegan, on the west coast
of Skye, for a year’s work, and lest he should be kept
longer than that time, MacLean was to go with him.
When Finlay went home and told his wife about the
journey he was to take, she said to him, “You are very
foolish to go so far away, when MacLean is giving you a good
livelihood.” “I must go at any rate, and you must come with
me,” he said, and told her how he was not to remain in Skye,
and that MacLean himself was going with him to make sure he
would not be kept there, and that she was to go with them.
“How can I do that,” she said, “when MacLean will not allow
a woman in the same boat with him?” “I will put you in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
hogshead,” he said, “and when we reach Dunvegan there will
be feasting and enjoyment, and when the nobility of MacLeod
(<i>maithibh Siol Leòid</i>) are gathered, you will come in among
the company as a poor woman, and I will manage the rest in
such a way as that you may perhaps earn more than myself.”
She consented to this, and he put her at night with sufficient
provision in the boat. They reached Dunvegan safely (<i>le deadh
shoirbheachadh</i>). Finlay’s wife got away unnoticed from the
boat, and waited at a house near till the festivities began.
When the crew and those who came in the boat reached the castle,
there was much rejoicing; an abundant feast was provided, and
company gathered, and the usual customs when tables were
spread and guests invited, were observed. Among those who
came to the gathering was a dependent of good position, who,
through some trifling cause, had lost the favour of MacLeod.
Finlay observed that he kept aloof from the company, and
having ascertained the cause, advised him to pledge MacLeod’s
health, and at the same time make his grievance known. He
took the advice, and said,</p>

<p>“MacLeod’s own lands are not yet exhausted,” MacLeod said,
and he restored him to his former place and privileges, and he
never had to go to Mull or anywhere else for land.</p>

<p>During this time Finlay kept looking for his wife’s appearance,
and whenever he saw her in the doorway he called out to her,
“Poor woman! what has brought you here? It must be some
pressing need that made you come among the nobles of the
Clan Leod to-night. Tell your story, and sure am I they will
one and all be willing to give you help, and that they will not
let you away as empty-handed as you have come.” She said
she was a poor woman who was bringing herself through life
honestly as she best could, with help from those who took
notice of her poverty and gave her charity, and that she came
to the nobles of the Clan Leod, as they were gathered at this
time, to try if they would help her. “Let your countrymen do
as they like,” Finlay said, “I will give you a calving cow (<i>mart-laoigh</i>).”
MacLean looked at him in astonishment, and it was
no wonder, when he heard him give away the only cow the
poor woman in Balemartin had to the northern wife (<i>do ’n
chaillich thuathaich</i>). Everyone of the nobles present gave her
a similar gift, till she had the nine cows. When the company
left, and MacLean had an opportunity of speaking to Finlay,
he said to him, “What made you give the only cow you had to
the northern wife?” “Do you know who the wife is?” Finlay
said. “What do I care what wife she is or was,” MacLean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
said. “It was just my own wife who was there and got all the
cows, and you need not give her yours till you return home,”
Finlay said. “And how did you bring her here?” MacLean
asked. “Ods! MacLean,” he said, “just in the big hogshead
at your feet in the galley.” “No death will ever happen to you
but to be hanged for your quirks” (<i>cha tig bàs ortsa ’m feasd
ach do chrochadh le d’ raoitean</i>), MacLean said, and he advised
him to send the cattle to Mull, till they could be ferried to
Tiree. Finlay took the advice, and sent his wife and the cows
to MacLean’s place at Benmolach, on the north-west side of
Mull, and she got them to Balemartin, where MacLean on his
return home sent her his own gift.</p>

<p>Finlay began his work and went on diligently with it that he
might be ready at the end of the year to return home, and
MacLeod came frequently where he was, more to hear what he
had to say than to see the progress he was making with his
work. One day, happening to find him at his breakfast, and
observing that Finlay began at the back with a shape of butter
(<i>measgan-ìme</i>) that was set before him, MacLeod asked him
when he had finished, why he did not begin at the front of it.
“I took it just from back to front as was wont at MacLean’s
table, where the measures were round (<i>far nach biodh na
measgain ’n am bloidhean</i>)” On another occasion MacLeod
found him paring a remnant of cheese (<i>cùl càise</i>), and asked
him when he had learned to pare cheese. “Since I came
to MacLeod’s Castle,” he said: “it was not the custom to
put a remnant on the inviting, merry, bountiful table in MacLean’s
house (<i>air bòrd fiughaireach, aighearach, fialaidh
Mhic’illeathain</i>).”</p>

<p>When the year had expired, MacLean, as had been agreed
on, went to bring Finlay home. He was cordially received by
MacLeod and was enjoying, after his journey, the usual hospitalities
prepared for guests of his rank, when he heard the sound
of Finlay’s hammer: “My loss! (<i>mo chreach!</i>),” he said, “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
too long delayed going where Finlay is.” When he reached
him, he said, “Excuse me, Finlay, I have been rather a long
time of coming where you are.” “I know that, MacLean,” he
said,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>MacLean then asked after his welfare during the year, and
said among other things, he would like to hear what were his
opinions of the women of the MacLeod country since his
coming among them. “Well, I will tell you that,” Finlay said,</p>

<p>“They will not be well pleased with your words.” “They
will be better pleased with my words than I have been with
their ways,” Finlay said; “I see it is time to return to Tiree,”
MacLean said.</p>

<p>When Finlay went to get payment from MacLeod before
leaving, and as they were conversing together after settling between
them, MacLeod said he would lay a wager that the peats of
Tiree would not burn so well as the peats of Skye. “What is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
your opinion, Finlay?” MacLean asked; “Shall I accept the
wager?” “Well, as a matter of indifference I will wager they
will not burn as well as those of the White Moss in Tiree
(<i>Leòra! cuiridh mise geall uach gabh iad co maith ri mòine
Bhlàir-bhàin ’an Tireadh</i>),” Finlay said, and the wager was
laid. “I will try another wager,” MacLeod said, “that our
dogs will thrash the MacLean dogs.” This wager was also
accepted, and MacLeod came to Tiree with them, bringing
peats and dogs with him in the galley. On putting the wagers
to the test, the Skye peat when kindled lighted brightly with a
great flare, but was soon burnt out. MacLean then asked if
they would try the Tiree kind now. As none had been brought
by the servants, and as it had previously been agreed on between
them, MacLean asked Finlay to go for them himself. Finlay
said perhaps it would not be the best that he would bring in.
He went out, and gathering an armful of peats took and steeped
them one by one (<i>fòid an déigh fòid</i>) in a cask of oil.
When MacLeod saw them he said, “O man, how wet they are!
(<i>O dhuine, nach iad a tha fliuch</i>).” “The wetter they are, the
livelier they will burn (<i>mar a’ s fliuiche ’s ann a’ s braise iad</i>),”
Finlay replied, putting them on; and when they took fire they
nearly burned the house. “Did I not say they would burn
better than those of Skye,” Finlay said to MacLeod, “and you
have lost the wager.” “Undoubtedly I have,” the other replied.
Next day the dog fight (<i>tabaid chon</i>) was to be tried. Finlay
rose early and gave his dogs the strongest “crowdie” (<i>fuarag</i>,
a mixture of milk and meal), and though they were smaller
when the fight began, MacLeod’s dogs could not hold one
bout with them. “It is surprising,” MacLeod said, “when
one of my dogs is as big as two of MacLean’s dogs.” “You
need not be at all surprised,” Finlay said, “those here are of
the race of dogs that were in the land of the Fians (<i>so sìolachadh
nan con a bh’ aca ’s an Fhéinn</i>), and no other kind need try
their strength against them.” “If you were in the land of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Fians, you came back, and no one need lay a wager with
MacLean so long as he has you with him.” MacLeod bade
them farewell and returned home (<i>Dh’ fhàg e beannachd aca
’s thill e dhachaidh</i>).</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BIG_DEWAR_OF_BALEMARTIN_TIREE">BIG DEWAR OF BALEMARTIN, TIREE.</h3>
</div>


<p>He was John MacLean, a native of Dowart in the island of
Mull, who fled to Jura.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> He is said to have been the first man
from that island who settled in Tiree, and on that account was
known as Dewar (<i>Diùrach</i>).<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He and his seven sons were alike
powerful and strong men. They held the township of Balemartin
(on the south side of Tiree), including Sorabi, where a burying
ground is, and where there was at one time a chapel to which
was attached the land of Sorabi garden. At this time the
people in the island were paying rent or tax (<i>cìs</i>), but it was
found impossible to make big John Dewar submit to pay the tax.
The first time any attempt was made to compel him to pay it,
he took with him his seven sons to Island-House, the proprietor’s
residence, and put them on the sward in front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
house (<i>air dòirlinn an eilein</i>), saying, “This is the payment I
have brought you, and you may take it or leave it.” Another
attempt to enforce payment from him ended as told in the
following account:&mdash;</p>

<p>One day when he and his sons were ploughing, two of the
sons being at Sorabi, as there were few people in the neighbourhood,
and his sons were at some distance from him, he
had to go himself to the smithy to repair the ploughshare (<i>a
ghlasadh an t-suic</i>). It was the beginning of summer, and he
left the horses in the plough, eating the wild mustard (<i>sgeallan</i>)
in the field where he was ploughing, grass and other herbage
being scant. While their father was away at the smithy, the
sons who were at Sorabi, on taking a look seawards, observed a
boat (<i>bìrlinn</i>) coming in towards the shore. It kept its course for
the small bay of boats (<i>port nan long</i>), in Balemartin, and had on
board a very strong man called “Dark John Campbell” (<i>Iain
Dubh Caimbeul</i>), who was sent to collect the tax from those in
the island who were unwilling to pay it. He had an able crew
with him in the boat. They landed, and when they reached
the place where Dewar was ploughing, the first thing they did
was to seize the horses in the plough (<i>na h-eich a bha ’s an
t-seisreach</i>), to take them away in the boat as payment of the
tax. When they were almost ready to be off, Dewar came in
sight on his return from the smithy. On seeing the unwelcome
strangers he quickened his steps to intercept them, and took
hold of the horses to take them back. Campbell drew his
sword, bidding him be off as fast as he could or he would put
his head beside his feet. Dewar drew his own sword and said,
“Come on and do all you are able.” The fray began between
them, and Dewar was driving Campbell, Inveraray, backwards
until he put him in among the graves (<i>lic</i>) in the burying-ground,
and it so happened that Campbell stumbled on MacLean’s
cross and fell backwards. Before he could raise himself Dewar
got the upper hand of him. On seeing him fall, his men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
certain that he must have been killed, and they went away with
the horses to the boat and put off to sea. “Let me rise,”
Campbell said, “and I will give you my word that I will never
come again on the same errand.” “I will,” Dewar said, “but
give me your oath on that, that it will be as that (<i>gu ’m bi sin
mar sin</i>).” Campbell gave his word, “and more than that,”
he said, “I will send you the value of the horses when I reach
Inveraray.” “You will now come with me to my house,” Dewar
said, “and you need not have fear or dread; your house-quarters
and welcome will not be worse than my own, till you
can find a way of returning home.” In the course of some days
Campbell got away, and he never returned again to “bullyrag” or
intimidate any one. On reaching Inveraray he was as good as
his word. He sold the horses and sent the price to Dewar, who
was never compelled to pay the tax.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_BIG_LAD_OF_DERVAIG">THE BIG LAD OF DERVAIG.</h3>
</div>


<p>Contemporary with John Dewar of Balemartin, Tiree, the Big
Lad was living at Dervaig, Mull, with his father, Charles, son
of Fair Neil of Dervaig. This lad, as he grew up to manhood,
became noted for his great strength and prowess, as well as for
his handsome person. At the same time he was reckless and
foolish. Despising his father’s reproofs and heedless of his
counsel, advice or admonitions, he went on in his mad career<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
until at last he purloined money from him, with which he
bought a ship and went sailing away, none of his friends knew
whither. After some years he returned home, broken-down in
appearance, empty-handed, and a complete “tatterdemalion,”
having wrecked his ship on the coast of Ireland, and lost all
the wealth he had accumulated to repay his father, who was
now dead. The grieve (<i>an t-aoirean</i>) had the land, and he went
where he was. The grieve told him about his father’s death,
and advised him to go to his father’s brother, Donald, son of
fair Neil, who had Hynish, Tiree, at that time, and whatever
advice he would get from him, to follow it, and he (the grieve)
would give him clothing and means to take him there, on
condition of being repaid when he returned. As there was no
other way open to him of redeeming his past errors, he agreed
to the grieve’s conditions and went to Tiree to his uncle, by
whom he was coldly received. “What business has brought
you, and where are you going when you have come here?”
“To ask advice from yourself,” he said. “Good was the
advice your father had to give, and you did not take it; what
I advise you to do is, to go and enlist in the Black Watch, and
that will keep you out of harm. You will stay here to-night,
and I will give you money to-morrow morning to take you to
the regiment,” his uncle said. His uncle was married to a
daughter of MacLean, Laird of Coll. Her husband did not
tell her of his nephew’s arrival, as he was displeased at his
coming. When the Big Lad was leaving the house next
morning, she saw him passing the window and asked who the
handsome-looking stranger was. On being told, she made him
return to the house, gave him food, drink, and clothing, and
on parting, money to take him on his way. He returned to
Dervaig, paid the ploughman his due, and went off to the wars.
At the first place he landed, said to be Greenock, a pressgang
was waiting to seize whoever they could get to suit the king’s
service, and on seeing this likely man they instantly surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
him, to carry him off by force. He turned about and asked
what they wanted with him. They said, “To take you with
us in spite of you.” When he understood their intentions he
opened his arms to their widest extent and drove all those
before him, eighteen men, backwards into the sea, and left
them there floating to get out the best way they could. He
then made his way till he enlisted in the Black Watch, then on
the eve of leaving for America, where it remained for seven
years. During that time the Big Lad (<i>an Gille mòr</i>) won the
esteem and commendation of his superiors in rank, by his
exemplary conduct and good bearing, as well as the
admiration and affection of his equals, to whom he was
courteous and forbearing. When the regiment was returning
to England, the officers frequently spent their leisure time, on
board of the man-of-war that brought it home, playing dice.
One day, when they were at their games, the Big Lad was looking
on, and he saw a young man, one of the English officers,
insolently, but more in jest than in earnest, striking on the ear
the colonel of the regiment, who, the Big Lad knew, was a
Highlander. When he saw the insult was not resented, he said
in Gaelic to the Colonel, “Why did you let him strike you?”
(<i>C’ ar son a leig thu leis do bhualadh?</i>). “You are, then, a
Highlander,” the colonel said to him, “and you have been with
me for seven years without telling me that you are.” “If you
would do what I ask you, I will make you one that he will not
do the same thing to you again,” he said to the colonel.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to do?” the colonel said. “That
you will write out my discharge when we reach London,” he
said. “But a soldier cannot get his discharge without an order
(stamped) under the crown,” the colonel said. “Write what
you can for me and I will not plead for more,” he said.
“Anything I can write will not do you any good,” the colonel
said. “Write that itself,” he said; and he got it written. Next
time the play was going on, the Big Lad looked on, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
he saw the same one striking the colonel again, he went to him
and asked why he did it. The reply he got was that soldiers
were not allowed to question their officers. “This is my way
of excusing myself,” the Big Lad said, giving him a blow he
had cause to remember all his life, if he ever recovered from
it. The soldier was sentenced to be severely punished, but on
arriving in England, he deserted&mdash;though desertion of the army
is not a custom of Highland soldiers&mdash;and became a fugitive.
The great esteem in which he was held prevented any one from
hindering his flight. He got ashore at night among the baggage,
and harbour lights not being numerous in those days, he could
not easily be seen making his escape. Whenever he got his
foot on land he set off, and during the remainder of the night
he ran on flying from pursuit. In the day-time he hid himself
under hedges and haystacks, and next night fled on. On the
following day he was becoming exhausted, and he ventured to
ask food at a wayside house. As his appearance was that of a
poor soldier he got scanty fare, but he asked with civility for
better food, and it was given to him. While he was taking it
two strangers came in to the same room with him, and seeing
his table well supplied while their own was poorly furnished,
one of them said, “It is strange to see a Highland soldier with
good food, while we have next to nothing,” and he went over
and swept away all the meat from the soldier’s table to his own.
The soldier called the mistress of the house and asked her who
the men were. She said they were travellers, and she asked
them why they took the meat from the soldier’s table, and told
them if they had in a civil manner asked better food for themselves
they would have got it, instead of raising a quarrel. The
soldier said he would settle the quarrel; and finding a large
iron hoop (<i>lùbach mhòr iaruinn</i>) at hand, he straightened it (a
fathom in length) and flung it round the head of the one
nearest to him, then twisted it in a noose and put the other
one’s head in the remainder. He then drew them both out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
after him, and left them on the high road. “Now,” he said to
them at parting, “you can travel on, for you will not come out
of that tie till you are put in a smithy fire (<i>teallach gobhainn</i>).”
He returned to pay the hostess, who said to him, “You do not
appear to have much money.” “I have seven day’s pay of a
soldier left, to pay my way,” he said. “Good youth,” she said,
“here is double the amount to you, to take you on your
journey, and I am sufficiently repaid by your ridding my house
of disagreeable guests.” He took the gift thankfully, and
turned his face northwards, to come to Scotland (<i>Albainn</i>).
The next evening, he saw a fine house, to which he went in the
dusk, and asked permission to warm himself. He was allowed
to enter, and while standing with his back to the fire, the
daughter of the house saw the handsome stranger, and she told
her father. He desired food to be given to him, and that he was
to be sent where he was. When she went with this request,
the soldier asked who her father was. She said he was a
nobleman (<i>àrd-dhuin’ uasal</i>). “A soldier is a bad companion
for a nobleman,” he said. He went with her and saw her
father, a grey-haired man in a chair, looking about him. The
soldier was asked to sit down. After conversing some time,
the old man said, “Young man, I have a daughter here who
gives me much trouble to keep her in company. If you can
play cards (<i>iomairt chairtean</i>), take my place at the table; there
is a money reward (<i>duais airgid</i>) for every game won.” “I have no
money,” the soldier replied. “I will lend you some,” she said. The
play went on till he won six games, one after another. He then
wanted to stop playing, and offered her back all the winnings,
but she would only take the sum she lent him, saying the rest
was rightly his own. He was to remain there that night, and
was not to go away in the morning without telling them. Being
afraid of pursuit, he went away at daybreak. He had not gone
far when he knew that a horseman was coming after him. He
waited to see if he was sent to get back the money he had won<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
at the card table; but it was a messenger with a request to him
from the nobleman to return to the castle. When he appeared
the nobleman chid him for leaving the castle unknown to him,
and told him how his daughter had fallen in love with him, and
had resolved never to marry any one else. The soldier said,
“A soldier is a poor husband for her.” The nobleman was
convinced that he was not a common soldier whatever circumstances
had placed him in that position, and said he preferred
his daughter’s happiness to wealth or rank. He remained with
them and married the daughter; and when he laid aside the
soldier’s dress, there was not his equal to be seen in the new dress
provided for him. He was esteemed for the dignity of his
demeanour as much as he was admired for his fine appearance,
and he lived, without remembrance of his past misadventures,
in the enjoyment of happiness and prosperity. In those days
news travelled slowly, newspapers appearing only once or twice
a year in populous villages, and they did not reach remote
places. In one which came to the nobleman at this time, there
was an account of two men tied in an iron rod (<i>ann an slait
iaruinn</i>) who were being exhibited at a market town in England.
He went with the nobleman and his friends to see this wonder,
the two who were in the union (<i>an dithis a bha ’s a’ chaigionn</i>).
Whenever the men saw the Highlander they said to him “If
you were dressed in the kilt, we would say you were the man
who put us in this noose.” “If you had been more civil,” he
said to them, opening the coil, “when you met me, you would
not to-day be fools going through England with an iron rod
round your necks.” On this he was cheered by the people,
and if he was held in esteem before, he was much more on his
return home, where he remained and became a great man
(<i>duine mòr</i>), beloved and esteemed to the end of his life.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="STORY_OF_DONALD_GORM_OF_SLEAT">STORY OF DONALD GORM OF SLEAT.</h3>
</div>


<p>Donald Gorm was at one time in the Island of Skye with his
galley and crew. When returning home to Uist, the day they
set out happened to become very stormy, and stress of weather
obliged them to return and make straight for Dunvegan, the
nearest place of shelter they could reach, where Donald Gorm
was not very willing to go if he could in any way avoid landing
there, since he had killed MacLeod of Dunvegan in a quarrel<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
which had arisen between them; but there was no alternative.
On observing the boat coming and in danger of being lost
MacLeod and the men of Dunvegan went to the shore to meet
them, and when they were safely landed gave them a kindly reception.
MacLeod took them with him to his castle and provided
hospitably for them. Donald Gorm was invited to MacLeod’s
own table, but refused, saying, “When I am away from home,
like this, with my men, I do not separate from them but sit
with them.” MacLeod said, “Your men will get plenty of
meat and drink by themselves, and come you with me.” “I
will not take food but with my men,” he said. When MacLeod
saw that Donald Gorm was resolved not to be separated
from his own men, and being unwilling to let him sit with
his, he asked in preference Donald Gorm’s men to his own
company. When dinner was over, drinking commenced, and
MacLeod becoming warm said to Donald Gorm by way of
remembrance, “Was it not you who killed my father?” “It
has been laid to my charge that I killed three contemptible
Highland lairds (<i>trì sgrogainich de thighearnan Gaidhealach</i>),
and I do not care though I should put the allegation on its
fourth foot to-night;” Donald Gorm said, drawing his dirk:
“There is the dirk that killed your father; it has a point, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
haft (<i>faillein</i>), and is sharp edged, and is held in the second
best hand at thrusting it in the west.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> MacLeod thought he
was the second best hand himself, and he said, “Who is the
other?” Donald Gorm shifted the dagger to his left hand,
raised it, and said, “There it is.” MacLeod became afraid
and did not revive any other remembrance. When Donald
Gorm was offered a separate room at night, he said, “Whenever
I am from home I never have a separate bed from my men but
sleep in their very midst until I return to my own house again.”
They told him that his men had a sleeping-place provided for
them, and that he would be much better accommodated by
himself in the room prepared for him. When they saw he
could not be persuaded to alter his determination of passing
the night with his men, they made beds for himself and men
in the kiln (<i>àth</i>).<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The men, being wearied, slept without care,
but Donald Gorm did not close an eye. He had a friend,
somehow, in his time of need (<i>caraid éiginn air chor-eiginn</i>), in
the place, who came secretly to the kiln where he and his men
lay, and called to him, “Is it a time to sleep, Donald?” (<i>An
cadal dhuit, a Dhòmhnuill?</i>) “What if it is?” (<i>’Dé na ’m b’ è?</i>),
he answered from within the kiln. “If it is, it will not be”
(<i>na ’m b’ è cha bhì</i>), said the one outside. “Waken men, and
rise quickly,” he said to his company. They got up at once
and with all speed went out, shutting the door of the kiln
behind them when they were all through to the outside. They
fled straight to the shore and launched their boat; and fortunately
for them the wind had calmed and they were able to put out
oars and row the galley some distance from the shore before
their flight was observed. They had not gone far to sea before
they saw the kiln on fire. “In place of your father and grandfather
you have left yourself without a house, and Donald
Gorm is where you cannot reach him,” Donald Gorm said, and
he got safely home to his own house without hurt or injury
(<i>gun bheud gun mhilleadh</i>).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">[18]</a> The quarrel in which MacLeod was killed was caused, it is said,
by Donald Gorm’s having repudiated his wife, who was a daughter
of MacLeod, in order to marry MacKenzie of Kintail’s sister, and
MacLeod resenting the insult attacked Donald Gorm, who killed him
and his two sons by throwing them over precipices in the Coolin hills
in Skye where the skirmish took place. A different version of this
incident is given in an early account of the “Troubles in the isles
betwixt the Clan Donald and the Seil Tormot, the year 1601,” and is
to the effect that the feud was carried on by “Sir Rory MacLeod of
the Herries,” brother-in-law of Donald Gorm MacDonald of Sleat,
the reprisals being fierce and frequent until the MacLeods were
beaten at “Binguillin,” where a brother of Sir Rory and other chief
men of his party were taken prisoners by Donald Gorm, but on a
reconciliation taking place they were set at liberty. (See Gregory’s

oaken cudgel in his hand. The laird’s wife happened to be the
first person he met, and without any preliminary word he asked,
“Is the lad Mac ’ic Ailein at home?” (<i>Bheil am balach Mac ’ic
Ailein a stigh?</i>) “No, he is not, at this time,” she answered indignantly
resenting his superciliousness. The next question he asked
was, “Will it be a long time before he comes home?” “I don’t
know,” she said. “You will tell him when he returns home,
that I was asking for him here, and that The Herd is the name
I get (<i>gur e am Buachaille a their iad rium</i>).” Mac ’ic Ailein
came home soon afterwards, and his wife told him about the
bold man who was enquiring. At her husband’s request she
described the stranger’s appearance and dress, and how “The
Herd” was the name he got. “Did you ask him in?” her
husband asked. “No,” she said, “he was so impertinent.”
“None but me will pay the penalty for that,” he said, “for he
was Donald Gorm of Sleat” (<i>Dòmhnull Gorm Shléibhte</i>).
Mac ’ic Ailein desired a horse to be saddled, and he rode at
full speed after, and overtook, Donald Gorm at the inn. After
much entreaty he was persuaded to return to Mac ’ic Ailein’s
house. On their arrival his wife made ample apology, and the
friendship was not broken.</p>

<p>Mac ’ic Ailein had to hold MacConnel, the Herd of the Isles
(<i>Mac Chonnuill Buachaille nan Eileinean</i>) stirrup at every feast
and fair.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_BLACK_RAVEN_OF_GLENGARRY">THE BLACK RAVEN OF GLENGARRY.</h3>
</div>


<p>The boundary line between the estates of Glengarry and Kintail
was, for ages, a winding river (<i>amhuinn cham</i>, literally “crooked
river”) which often overflowed its banks, changed its course,
and made encroachments on the land, sometimes on one side
and as frequently on the other, causing disputes and quarrels,
in regard to their respective rights and limits, between the
proprietors of the estates which it separated; the tenantry (<i>an
tuath</i>) on each property taking the part of their chief when the
strife ran high. In order to put an end to the quarrelling the
Chief of Glengarry (<i>Mac ’Ic Alasdair</i>) at this time insisted on
a straight line being drawn to mark the boundary between them,
but MacKenzie of Kintail would not give his assent to any
proposal for changing the old line which followed the course of
the river, and the feud broke out afresh (<i>bha an tabaid air a
bonn a rithist</i>). Glengarry had three sons, and in the skirmish
that took place on that occasion the two eldest sons were killed.
The youngest having been left at home on account of his
youth, escaped the fate of his brothers. He became known
afterwards as the Black Raven of Glengarry. When he grew
up to manhood his father said to him one day, “An insulting
message (<i>fios tàmailteach</i>) has been sent to me from Kintail
about the boundary line, and I must accept the challenge and
gather the men, and you must go with us.” “If it is fighting you
have in view,” said the Raven, “you must do it yourself, for me;
my two dear brothers were killed through your foolish quarrels,
and I would have been killed also if I had been old enough to be
with them at the time, but since I can now understand how
trifling the cause is, I will let yourselves be fighting.” His
father could only gather his men and go to the contest without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
him. When they were out of sight, the Raven put on his best
suit of armour and took several turns round the hill to elude
the notice of any straggler who might have been left, and then
set off at his utmost speed to get in advance of his father and
men. Before evening closed he was at the head of Loch
Duich, where he passed the night. Next day he procured a
plaid of MacKenzie tartan which he wrapped round him to
disguise the red badge (<i>suaicheantas dearg</i>) of Glengarry, and
made his way to the enemy’s headquarters at Donan Isle
(<i>Eilean donnan</i>), where the Kintail men were rapidly gathering
to the fray. It was customary in those days to set a large long
table (<i>bòrd mòr fada</i>) supplied with abundance of food and
drink for the entertainment of the men who assembled from
far and near. The Chief sat at the head, and every man on
taking his place stuck his dirk (<i>biodag</i>) in the edge of the table
in front of him before sitting down. The Black Raven got in
among the men unnoticed, and when the Chief of Kintail came
in, he said to the man who was beside him, “I wish to sit next
to Kintail.” His appearance did not betray him, and no one
objected to his request, but when he was taking the seat beside
the Chief, he threw MacKenzie backwards on the ground and
put his foot upon him to keep him down, and the point of his
dirk resting on the breast of the prostrate man. His plaid having
slipped aside, the red (<i>an dearg</i>) was exposed, and in an instant
a hundred dirks were ready to riddle him (<i>g’ a dheanamh ’n a
chriathar-tholl</i>); but he said, commanding them, “The moment
I am approached, your Chief will be a dead man.” “If I fall,”
he said to the Chief, “it will be on the hilt of my own weapon,
and you will never rise&mdash;its point is on your breast, and any
attempt to take my life imperils yours. I did not come here
for war but for peace, and unless you will consent to lay aside
all animosities, and solemnly promise never to renew this
quarrel, your life is forfeited. I have only to press the hilt of
this dagger, on which my hand rests, and whatever fate awaits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
me you will have no more power to do harm.” Kintail agreed
to make peace, and gave his oath twice on the cold iron of the
dirk on his breast that he would faithfully keep his promise.
The Black Raven, after sharing in the hospitalities provided for
the occasion, returned home, the Chief and men of Kintail
accompanying him part of the way. When he met his father
with his band of fighting men, he told them to return home,
that he had done alone more than they had ever been able to
do with all their boasting and fighting; he had put an end to
their fighting, and got a guarantee for a lasting peace without
one drop of bloodshed, and henceforth if he found any one
among them making or renewing the quarrel, he would give
the Chief of Kintail full liberty to treat them as he saw proper.</p>

<p>The friendship then made between the Chieftains was ever
afterwards steadily maintained by them, and the Raven became
one of the most distinguished men in the service of his country
at that time.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CAILLEACH_POINT_OR_THE_OLD_WIFES" title="CAILLEACH POINT OR THE OLD WIFES HEADLAND.">CAILLEACH POINT, OR THE OLD WIFE’S
HEADLAND,</h3>
</div>


<p>Is one of the stormiest and most dangerous headlands on the
west coast of Scotland. From base to top it is rocky, and for
a considerable distance on each side.</p>

<p>It faces the Island of Coll, and commands a view of the
Point of Ardnamurchan, from which it is distant about seven
or eight miles. At its base there is a strong tidal channel
which has never been known to be dry at the lowest ebb tide.
From its highest point the spectre of “Hugh of the Little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
Head” is said to cross on horseback to Coll to give warning,
as he is wont to do, to any descendants of the house of Lochbuie
of their approaching end. Hugh is said to have had his
head cut off by a broad sword in one of the clan skirmishes of
old times. He has his head in a blaze of fire, and the tracks
of his horse seen on the snow shew only three legs, and the
terror of children and credulous people is increased by his
being said to drag a chain after him. To the south of the
Point there is a cave, which becomes accessible only when the
tide has half fallen. Its Gaelic name is <i>Uamh Bhuaile nan
Drogh</i>. Wild pigeons tenant it, and are seen emerging when
the tide has fallen. The cooing sound of the birds heard
under water seems to have led to the name, which means, the
Cave of the Cattle-fold of the fairies, and it is noticeable that
the word <i>Drogh</i> denotes that it first received its name from a
Teutonic source, very possibly from the race that came ultimately
to tenant the Orkney islands. It is said, however, that
Dutchmen possessed the fisheries on the west coast of Scotland,
and it has been suggested that the word <i>Drogh</i> is from Dragnet,
which they kept in the cave. The tides which sweep past
this point render it more difficult and dangerous to get past in
a head wind than even the Point of Ardnamurchan, of which
the dangerous character is well known. To the north of the
Point in the direction of Croig in Mull, there is an indentation
which is called <i>Achlais na Caillich</i> (the old woman’s oxter or
armpit) where salmon nets are set. It has been characterised
as not the armpit of a smooth woman (<i>Achlais na mnà mìne</i>)
and the story which is said to have given its name to the
Headland, is, that an old woman was gathering shell-fish in the
neighbourhood when the tide began to make, and the woman
finding no other means of escape made a last effort by climbing
up the rocks. When at the top, and almost out of danger, she
said “I am safe now, in spite of God and men” (<i>Tha mi
tearuinte nis ge b’ oil le Dia ’s le daoine</i>). She was converted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
into a stone forming part of the rock distinctly to be seen from
the highest point of <i>Cailleach</i>. It is said that the figure of the
old woman was very distinctly to be seen at first, and hence the
name of the Headland, but time has done its own work and
the figure is not now so unmistakable. Even the origin of the
name is only known to those who are natives of the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On one occasion, the writer being himself ensconced under
the side deck of a smack, then plying to the island, heard a
Tiree boatman, who was conversing with a minister from the
south of Argyleshire, and had no fancy for the overly pious
talk of the too-zealous stranger, remarking that there was an
old woman here and when she gave a snort, she could be heard
over in Coll. [“<i>Tha Cailleach an so ’s trà nì i sreothart cluinnidh
iad ’an Cola i.</i>”] The minister said that that was most extraordinary,
and as it now began to rain the boatman began to
exhort him to go below, and professed much regard for the
minister’s health. At last he got rid of him.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="A_TRADITION_OF_ISLAY">A TRADITION OF ISLAY.</h3>
</div>


<p>The western isles according to tradition were thinly inhabited
for a long period of years, after the defeat and expulsion of the
Norsemen. These invaders had left few of the natives alive
and the land remained desolate. The first man then who took
possession of the country was powerful John MacConnal who
was called, the shepherd of the isles, and the first of the lords
of the isles (<i>Iain mòr Maconuil ris an abairteadh buachaille nan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
eileanan, b’e ceud tighearna nan eileanan</i>). He had seven sons,
among whom, when they came of age, he began to divide his
possessions, but the Highlands and isles being too limited in
his opinion for division among so many, he went away to
Ireland with one of his sons, to overthrow one or more of the
five kings by whom that country was then governed, and put
his son in possession of any territory he might acquire in the
contest, leaving his eldest son in Islay, which was the first of
the isles possessed by him. In this enterprise he succeeded in
seizing that part of Ireland then under the authority of the
Earl of Antrim, and gave it to his son, whose nephew
came from Islay, when some years had passed, to see him
in Antrim. This nephew during one of those visits fell in
love with a noblewoman of the country whom he asked in
marriage. His proposal being agreed to, he was requested, as
was then the custom, to name the dowry he wanted with her.
His request was 700 men who had nicknames (<i>far-ainmeannan</i>)
to take with him to Islay. In those days, it is said, that great
men and nobles only had pseudonyms and he took this method
of getting these and their followers to repeople the isles, and
their descendants are yet to be found in many parts of the
country as well as in the islands.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 title="">NOTES:</h4>

<div class="ml10 mr10">
<p>Islay is separated from the island of Jura by the sound of Islay
and lies west of Cantyre in Argyleshire. Its extent is 25 miles long
and 17 miles broad. The south west point is called the Rhinns (<i>an
roinn Ileach</i>). The island is hilly and penetrated by an arm of the
sea, Lochindaal, which is 12 miles long and 8 miles broad. There
are good crops grown on the island and cattle are reared and fish is
abundant on its coasts. A small quantity of various kinds of ore is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
found throughout the island, but its distilleries are its chief industry
at the present day. It was in former times the chief residence of the
Lords of the Isles, and the ruins of castles, forts, and chapels are
numerous and interesting as records of a past age.</p>

<p>The Beatons or Bethunes and MacLarty are said to have been among
those who came from Ireland with <i>MacConuil</i>. The latter being
descendants of grey haired Niel (<i>Nial Liath</i>) who was interpreter
(<i>fear-labhairt</i>) for Maconnal, hence the name. It is told of Niel, that
being at one time surrounded by his enemies in a battle, he was
commanded to deliver his sword. “If I do,” he said, “it will be by the
point” (<i>ma liubhras, ’sann an aghaidh a ranna</i>), and cleaving his
way through them he escaped and joined his companions.</p>

<p>After his settlement in the western island MacConnal (<i>Iain Mòr
MacConuill</i>) is said to have divided his possessions among his seven
sons by sending one of them John (<i>Iain</i>) to Glencoe, hence the patronymic
Clan of the son of John of Glencoe (<i>Clann ’ic Iain Ghleann-a-comhunn</i>),
another son Ronald (<i>Raonull</i>) was sent to Keppoch (<i>a’
Cheapaich</i>), one Allan (<i>Ailean</i>) was sent to Moidart (<i>Mùideart</i>).
These were settled on the mainland in the counties of Argyle and
Inverness, while the island of Skye was given to another son, Grim
Donald of Sleat, (<i>Dòmhnull gorm Shléibhte</i>). Another son got the
smaller isles, and another went to Ireland and became Earl of Antrim
while the heir remained in Islay and held the adjacent islands as well
as portions of the mainland. Of the 700 who returned with his son
from Antrim to people the islands after the expulsion of the Norsemen,
22 were heads of families. The person from whom the writer
heard this, now above 70 years of age, was certain that Beaton or
Bethune was one of the names, but he had forgotten the others.</p>

</div>


<p class="p1_5">At the time when Lachlan Kattanach was Chief of MacLean
(<i>ri linn Mhic-’illeathain Lachunn Cattanach na gruaige</i>), his
wife (<i>a bhantighearna</i>) dreamt about an Irish chief of the
name of William O’Power (?) (<i>Uilleam O’ buaidh</i>) and in the
same way, at the same time, this Irish Chief dreamt about her.
It happened then that they began to communicate with each
other. (At that time more trade was carried on with Ireland
by these Western Isles than with any other place.) One day
MacLean discovered that his wife was keeping on a correspondence,
unknown to him, with the Irish Chief, and was much
distressed about this injury to his honour. In order to test his
wife’s affection for her secret lover, he went to her with a
penknife in his hand and said, “There is a present <i>O’ buaidh</i>
has sent you.” She looked at the knife and said,</p>

</div>

<p>MacLean was then convinced of his wife’s disgrace, and went
away and sent for his kinsman, Fair Lachlan (<i>Lachunn fionn</i>)
who was then at Hynish, and who, on receiving a message from
his Chief, went immediately to Island House. On reaching, MacLean
said to him, “I sent for you to go to Ireland; you are a
clever man and you have seven sons, go and bring me the
head of O’Power, and any crime you may commit, or any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
injustice you may from this time do to any one, will be over
looked by me (<i>tha thu ’n ad dhuine tapaidh ’s seachdnar mhac
agad, falbh ’s thoir g’ am ionnsuidh ceann Uilleam O’ buaidhe ’s
aona chron na anaceart sam bith nì thu theid a mhathadh dhuit
leamsa</i>). Next day, <i>Lachunn fionn</i> with his sons set off in the
galley, and before sundown he was in Islay. The following day he
was in Ireland, and asked the first person he met for the man he
was tracing (<i>a bha e air a luirg</i>). “If you wish to see him,” the
person said, “he is coming this way, in a coach drawn by two
white horses, and no one in Ireland has that but himself.” The
old man then went on to try and meet him, and after going a short
distance he saw him coming towards him to meet him (<i>chaidh
an sean duine air aghaidh feuch an tachradh e air, ’s an ceann
ceum na dhà chunnaic e e tighinn ’na choinneamh ’s ’na chòmhail</i>).
When he came near, O’Power (<i>O’ buaidh</i>) commanded him to
stop, and said, “I see you are a stranger in the place?”
“Indeed,” he replied, (<i>seadh ars’ esan</i>). “Whence have you
come?” the Chief asked, (<i>Co ás a thàinig thu?</i>). “I came
from Tiree,” he answered. “Do you know the lady of MacLean
there?” “I know her well,” he said. “Will you bring
her a message from me?” (<i>An toir thu fios uam g’ a h-ionnsuidh?</i>)
“I will,” he said, (<i>bheir, ars’ esan</i>). The chief there
and then put the message in order, and put his head out of
the coach to deliver it, but the other, while taking it with the
one hand, struck off his head with the other hand. (<i>Sin fhéin
chuir e ’n teachdaireachd air doigh ’s chuir e mach a cheann g’ a
toirt dà, ’s ’nuair bha e ’ga gabhail leis an aona laimh thilg e dheth
an ceann leis an laimh eile</i>). The man-servant was stupified
(lit. went astray), (<i>chaidh an gille air seacharan</i>), and Fair
Lachlan got an opportunity (<i>fhuair e fàth</i>) of taking the head
with him to the galley with which he set sail (<i>leig e ri cuain di</i>)
and was in Islay on his return journey that evening. Next day
after (<i>maireach ’na dheighinn sin</i>) he was in Tiree, and went
early in the day to Island House (<i>do ’n eilean</i>). Finding, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
reaching, that MacLean and his wife were at breakfast, he went
in where they were and put the head of the Irish Chief on the
end of the table, with the face towards MacLean’s wife. She
looked at it and fell down stone dead at the side of the table
(<i>sheall i air ’s thuit i fuar marbh aig taobh a’ bhùird</i>). Some
time after this Fair Lachlan’s sons were taking peats home
from Moss to Hynish. There were five of them with seven
horses, which were fastened together, and went on one after
another, having a sort of deep basket (<i>cliabh</i>) slung on each side
of each horse for the conveyance of burdens. On account of
Big Dewar of Balemartin, who was so fierce, (<i>co fiadhaich</i>) they
could not take the straight way by Balemartin to Hynish, but
had to take the more rugged path by Hynish hill, where, at
<i>Creag nan cliabh</i> (Creel rock) the footpath was so narrow that
on these occasions a person was in waiting to be in readiness
to take the creels off the horses and carry them past the rock.
At that time, there was a mill past Balviceon, with a bridge
across the dam which had to be lifted before sundown, and on
their way they had to pass across the bridge. It happened
on this occasion that the young men, by their own folly (<i>le ’n
amaideachd fhein</i>), were later than usual of returning, and the
bridge was withdrawn; and with the speed with which they
were going on, they did not observe that the bridge was lifted,
and the foremost of the horses went headlong into the dam
and was choked (<i>air a thachdadh</i>). The lads made their
way home, and told their father how the miller had taken
away the bridge, and what had happened to them. He
said, “If my horse was choked on his account (<i>air a thàillibh</i>),
the same thing will be done to him to-night yet”; and
that was what happened. He and his sons went back the
same way, step by step, (<i>air a’ cheart cheum</i>), and they caught
the poor man while he was asleep (<i>rug iad air an duine ’na
leabaidh</i>) and took him with them and hung him on the hillock
of the cross (<i>bac na croiche</i>), opposite Island House. When a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
servant went in early next morning to kindle a fire in the room
where MacLean was, he asked what sort of day it was. The
servant said that it was a good day, but that a strange sight was
to be seen (<i>ni a tha cuir ioghnadh mór orm ri fhaicinn</i>). “What
is that?” the Chief asked. “It is a man hung on the hillock up
yonder (<i>duine air a chrochadh air a’ chroich shuas ud</i>). MacLean
said, as he rose up, “Who or what person dared do this without
my permission? (<i>Co an aona duine ’san dùthaich aig an robh
’chridh leithid so dheanamh gun chuir ’nam cheadsa?</i>) When he
saw the deed that was done, he shed bitter tears, and said that no
one had done this but Fair Lachlan (<i>cha d’ rinn duine riamh
so ach Lachunn fionn</i>). “It was in the agreement I made with
him when he brought me the man’s head from Ireland.” This
was the last hanging that was done in the island (<i>b’e so an
crochadh mu dheireadh a rinneadh ’s an eilean</i>).</p>

A Story of Lochmaree.
</span><a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span></h3>
</div>


<p class="p1_5">At one time the King of Denmark is said to have sent his son
to the Scottish court along with six others (<i>seisear eile</i>). They
landed in Caithness, where, as they came chiefly for sport, they
began to look for deer and other wild animals, and to enquire
where they were to be found. They were told that all animals
of the chase had become scarce since more people had come
to that part, but that in the neighbouring parts of the country,
especially in Ross-shire, they were still numerous, and if they
went there they would get abundant sport. They went, and
while they remained lived in a house of the MacKenzies’, near
Lochmaree. One day then, when following deer in the hill,
the young prince got separated from his companions, who each
and all found their way safely home. When he came in sight
of the house, being fatigued, he sat down by the roadside and
fell asleep. He was awakened by the sound of voices, and on
looking he saw two men, one of whom was young and the other
old, coming on the road towards him with a young woman
walking between. He got up, and as they were coming nearer
he was making out that he never saw a more beautiful woman.
He stood before them and spoke. The old man said, “You
are doing wrong in delaying us on our way.” “Methinks,”
said the young prince, “that I am not doing any thing out of
the way, nor have I spoken a wrong word.” The old man got
angry, and calling him rough names said he was ill-bred. “That
was not the way in which I was taught,” the prince answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
“I have the blood of the kings of Denmark in my veins, and I
am inclined to put your head as low as your shoes for your
ill words (<i>air son do dhroch bheul</i>) which I have not deserved.”
When the old man heard this he became afraid, and made
excuses for the warmth of temper he had shewn, but said he
was under vows to protect the girl from all intrusion, “the
reason being that she is with us under the vows of the church
(<i>fo naomhachadh na h-eaglais</i>), by her father’s commands,” and
told him that they came ashore from the monastery of Isle-maree
and were to return before nightfall. “I would like well
to know who the maiden is whom you befriend,” said the
young prince. “The name of the daughter is,” the old man
answered, “Princess Thyra (<i>Deorath</i>) of the house of Ulster
in Ireland&mdash;and let us now pass.” In the parting the young
prince said to the maiden, “As this has been our first meeting,
so I fear it is to be our last: Farewell!” “I do not say,” she
answered. He went home, but, after some days, returned to
the same place expecting to see the same company, but no one
came ashore from the islet that day. The next time he went
he waited two days in vain, and the third time three days, and
returned home in the same way ill-pleased at his mischance.
He then resolved to go to the isle if there was a way of getting
to it. He was told that a man on the other side of the loch
had a boat, and he went to him and got him to go with him.
On landing, the man pointed out to him the way to the monastery,
and told him that he would come to a well, which he was
not to pass till he drank of its water; that the well was famed
for its efficacy in every malady to which mankind is subject,
and especially in restoring those who had lost their reason;
“and beside the well,” said the man, “there is a tree with a
hollow in its side (<i>slochd ’n a taobh</i>), and no one goes past it
without putting something of more or less value in.” The
youth went ashore, and, heedless of tree and well, reached
the house and demanded admittance at the first door he met.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
When asked what brought him, or why he came, he said he
came to see the Irish princess. He was told that could not be
(<i>ni nach gabhadh deanamh</i>). He then asked if there was any
one in authority of whom he could make the request, and was
told there was the oldest of rank in the monastery, who, when
he came, said, “No! you cannot see the princess.” The young
man then told who he was, and said, “If I want her for my
wife and she consents, can you prevent the union?” “We
will leave the matter to her own will,” the old man answered.
She came gladly, and the prince spent that day on the islet.
Before he left she said, “I have a doubt in this matter.”
“What is that?” he asked. “It is that I never saw you but
once before now, neither did you see me, and if love comes
quickly, it may go as quickly.” “You know that from yourself,”
he said. “No,” she answered. He told her to look at the
evening star, which was to be seen in the south-western sky,
and said, “As truly as that star shines on yonder hill, so truly
do I love you.” “I have another doubt,” she said. “Your
doubts are very many,” he said. Her doubt was, that Red
Hector of the hills, as he was called from being among the
hills day and night, would be a dangerous foeman if he met
him on his way. He returned, landed, and having cause, as
he thought, to be pleased with events, was going on joyously
and light-hearted, whistling as he went along. He was not far
on his way when an arrow passed close to his face; the next
one stuck in his bonnet. He stood looking about him and
saw a big man standing beside a rock that was at the roadside
before him. “What sort of man are you, when you are going
to make a target of me?” the prince said. “Have you never
heard of Red Hector of the hills (<i>Eachann Ruadh nan cnoc</i>)?
If you have not, you now see him and will feel his skill. There
is a matter to settle between us which can never be done but in
one way, and that is, that you kill me or I kill you.” They
took their swords, one each (<i>claidheamh an t-aon</i>), blood was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
shed; the prince then asked if there was no other way of
settling the matter except by bloodshed. “Do not waste
speech (<i>Na bi ’cosg do sheanachais</i>); that you kill me or I kill
you, there is no other way,” he said, and struck the prince on
the side with his sword and sorely wounded him. He fell and
his enemy fled. The wounded man kept his hand on the
wound, but whenever he moved the blood spurted from it, and
he was passing the night in that way till his tongue became
swollen in his mouth. In the midst of his agony he heard the
drip of a streamlet in the hollow underneath where he lay, and
tried to move himself towards it, but could not, though he
made every effort. At last he thought it was better to bleed to
death than die of thirst, and by dragging himself along he
reached the water, but before he got to drink of it he fainted
and lay beside the streamlet till next day, when those, the
humane people (<i>na daoine cneasda</i>), who came ashore in the
boat heard his moaning, and recognising him, took him back
to the islet, where he remained unconscious for many weeks,
during which his own men, who had been brought to the isle,
and the princess attended him. When he recovered and knew
that the maiden’s constant care and watchfulness had helped to
restore him to life, he expressed much gratitude. “When you
are up and well,” she said, “it will be time to thank me.” He
kept telling her every day how he would take her to Denmark.
One day then a ship was seen coming, from which a boat was
sent ashore to take away the maiden, whose father lay dying.
“Will you return?” he said. “I will return,” she said. “And
you will not forget me among your own people.” “Nothing
but death will prevent my return,” she said. She went away,
and nothing was heard of her for many days. In his impatience
the prince sent men from day to day to the top of the highest
hills to look for the ship. At last they saw three ships coming,
and the first had the royal flag of Ireland in its topmast. Some
time before the maiden left the islet, the prince one day when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
on land met an old man who intercepted him; his men bade
the intruder keep to one side of the road, but the man refused
to be put aside, and the prince then asked what his business
was with him. “Do not speak so gruffly,” the old man said,
“I have come to you, as I am in need of shelter, to ask if you
will take me into your service while you are here.” “My
burden is on others at present,” the prince said, “and little an
old man like you with a staff in his hand can do to help me.
Have you a house or home?” “I had till yesterday; to-day I
have nothing. I had house, wife, son, land, cattle, and yesterday
every beast that I had was lifted, except a stray sheep, and
my son went in search of it and fell over the rocks (<i>chaidh am
balach leis na creagan</i>) and was killed. When his mother heard
what had happened to him she went to the place, and on seeing
her son dead she leapt in the sea and was drowned, and I am
left alone. If you will take me with you I will do you more
service in the hills than a younger man can do.” He said his
name was MacKenzie (<i>Dùghall MacChoinnich</i>). The prince
took him to be with them while they remained in the isle.</p>

<p>When the ships were seen the prince went to the highest
summit of the hills, taking with him, among the rest, the old
man, who on their way said, “Delay (<i>air do shocair</i>), till I tell
you my dream.” “I care naught for dreams,” the other said.
“Will you not listen, for I dreamt the same dream three nights
after each other; and it was that she was dead.” “We wish to
get joyous news and you have given us instead news of sorrow.”
The old man then said, “I will go to the ship, and when I
reach, if all is well you will see a red signal, and if sorrow
awaits you it will be a black one.” He went, and on reaching,
she was there. She knew him and asked if all was well. He
told her, and she said, “He is impatient for news.” He then
persuaded the princess, against her own will and the advice of
those around her, to shew the death-signal, saying the joy of
seeing her living would compensate her lover for the deception.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
When the signal was seen by those on land, the prince said he
could no longer live, and took his dagger from its sheath and
killed himself. When the princess reached the shore, those
who met her told her how her lover, believing that she was
dead, had killed himself. She asked where he was, and said that
no seen or unseen power could prevent her from taking a last farewell,
and that she would go alone and do no injury to herself.
When she was going in where the dead body lay, she noticed
that some one was following her, and turning she saw that the
intruder was the old man, “Wretched Dugall (<i>a dhroch
Dhùghaill</i>), what evil advice you gave me.” “That is not my
name,” he said, “I am Red Hector of the hills, and this is my
revenge!” and he killed her with his dirk. He then disappeared
and was never seen or heard of in the country after
that time.</p>

<span class="smcap p85">A TRADITION OF HARRIS.</span></h3>
</div>


<p class="p1_5">At one time it is said the outermost of the western isles formed
three separate and independent possessions; the northern part
of the Long Island (<i>an t-eilean fada</i>),<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Lewis (<i>Leòdhais</i>), was
held by one Cenmal (<i>Ceannamhaol</i> [baldhead]), who was a
king, while the southern portion, Harris (<i>na h-Earra</i>), was
owned by a prince; and another king, one named Keligan
[thin one], possessed Uist, which is further south. In this way
Lewis and Uist had each a king, while there was only a prince
in Harris. This prince, who was famed for his courage and
bravery, was held in great esteem by those on his land for the
good advice (<i>na comhairlean dealbhach</i>) they readily got from
him and the benefits he conferred on them. He discouraged
bickerings and jealousy (<i>farmad</i>) among his subordinates and
neighbours, and spread among them a knowledge of many useful
arts. He encouraged manual labour as well as manly
exercise and the recitation of poems, romance, etc. His wife,
Garlatha, was not less namely for her goodness to those around
her, among whom she promoted thrifty and industrious habits,
and taught the use and methods of preparing different kinds of
roots, grain and plants, for food and healing, and to be kind
and tender to the weak and infirm, and to live good lives. In
this way the people on their land were contented with their
condition and sought no change. Garlatha died, it is said,
about 800 A.D.&mdash;a long time ago, but whatever it was, she
went away, (and it was not to be helped), leaving an infant
daughter who was named after her mother, Garlatha. As the
girl grew up it was seen that she inherited her mother’s good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
gifts, and the people were equally well pleased with her. In
time she began to be spoken about and heard of, and was
sought in marriage by numerous suitors. The king who ruled
in Lewis was eager in pursuit of her (<i>’an tòir oirre</i>), and crossed
over to see her. The ruler (<i>fear-riaghlaidh</i>) of Uist came on
the same errand. One day then her father said to her,
“Daughter, I wish to see you married, before the end of my
life comes, to a good man, and I am looking to see which of
those men who come to see you is the most suitable, and I see
that it will suit you best to take him who is in Lewis.” His
daughter preferred the one who owned Uist, but by her father’s
advice word was sent to the possessor of Lewis to come and
that he would get her. He came, and being well pleased with
his reception every arrangement was made, and they were
married. Afterwards the bride said to a maid, “You will go
in to the entertainment (<i>fleadh</i>) and among the company: I
am going to hide myself.” This was done, and the company
sat at the feast without the bride, for whose coming a long
delay was made. When it was seen that she would not return,
the question of what had become of her or where she was, was
asked of every one, but no one knew. The maid was asked,
but she had not any knowledge or tale (<i>fios no sgeul</i>) to tell of
where the lost one was to be found. The time was passing
<i>(bha ’n ùineachd ’ruith</i>) and search was made outside for her,
but she was not found. Then they looked for her from place
to place, where it was possible to find her, but without success.
The night passed, leaving the feast untouched and the guests
cheerless. Next day the search was renewed along the shores
and among the hills, and in every direction from day to day,
till there was not a spot between Barra Head and the Butt of
Lewis where a bird could sleep, that was not searched, but
there was no trace of her (<i>cha d’ fhuaireadh riamh i, cha d’
fhuaireadh idir i</i>). The father continued to wander about,
searching in vain, for many years after all hope of finding her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
was dead, till at last he was seen to turn every leaf he met with
the staff in his hand, and even to look under ragweed (<i>buaghallan</i>).
He died, and she was not found. The place, Harris,
was then 200 years without any one to own it (<i>thug an t-àite
sin dà cheud bliadhna gun duine ann</i>). MacLeod (<i>fear Mac
Leòid</i>) then took possession of the country and began to build
new houses; the old dwellings had become uninhabitable (<i>air
dol fàs</i>); the roof had fallen in (<i>thuit an ceann ’n am broinn</i>).
When clearing out one of these an old chest was found, and
on lifting it the lower part remained on the ground, with the
skeleton of a woman resting in it, each bone according to its
place (<i>cnàimh a réir cnàimh</i>), and by its side the wedding-ring,
as new as it was on the day it was put on her finger, with the
name “Garlatha” engraved on it, and from that the story came.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_TRADITION_OF_A_HOUSEWIFE_AND_HER">THE TRADITION OF A HOUSEWIFE AND HER
FAIRY VISITOR.</h3>
</div>


<p>The incidents of this tradition are said to have happened in
Lewis, but the readiness with which similar stories are appropriated
and localised makes it improbable that the circumstances
occurred in any special locality. In this instance the person
from whom the story was heard being a native of Lewis will
account for the incidents of the story having been said to have
taken place in that Island. The story is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The wife of a tenant farmer, who lived with his family in an
extremely remote and hilly rough district, was frequently left
alone in the house, as she had no daughters, while her husband
and sons were away at the labour of the farm, or fishing. It
happened one day after they had left, that the housewife having
finished her housework, sat as usual at the spinning-wheel to
spin thread for cloth (<i>clò</i>) for their clothing. She had not long
begun her labour, when, happening to look towards the door,
she saw a little woman of reddish appearance coming in at the
door with a dog before and one after her. “Woman,” she said,
“you are spinning.” “I am,” the housewife answered. “Will
you give me a drink of water?” she said. “Take it yourself,”
the housewife said. “The water is good, where is the well?”
she asked. “It is down,” said the one who was in, “in the opening
of the hollow of the glen (<i>aig dorus ’an lag a’ ghlinne</i>).” The
fay woman (<i>a’ bhean-shìth</i>) then asked the housewife to lend
her a small cauldron, and the other woman believing her to be
sister-in-law or some other relative she did not know of the wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of her nearest neighbour, who lived far distant from them and
was married to an Ardnamurchan woman, said to her, “There
is a table there with several utensils (<i>caigionn choireachan</i>) on
its shelf; take with you any of them that will answer.” When
she brought it, she asked for the suspender (<i>bùlas</i>) and lid.
The moment she got them she fitted them in and told the dogs
that were with her to take that with them. The dogs immediately
caught the three-legged pot and took it with them.
When her husband came home the housewife said, “I think
there is a stranger with our neighbours,” and told him about her
visitor. “Perhaps,” her husband said, “she is the sister-in-law;
it was time some one came to see the wife, for none of her
friends have been since she came here.” “I never saw the sort
of dogs she had, ever here,” his wife said, and described to him
the dogs and how they were different altogether from sheep-dogs.
“Our neighbours have only one dog and it is a sheep-dog,”
he said. This day passed and another and the third, but
the cauldron was not returned. The housewife then sent one
of her sons to ask the neighbours to return the loan. These
said that they did not get a loan of anything, as they did not
require it, having more cauldrons and kettles than was required
by themselves, and that no strangers had come or were with
them. The housewife was at her wit’s end and did not know in
the world or time to come (<i>uile bheatha na dìlinn</i>) what to
think about the matter. On the fifth day, however, the self-same
one returned with the cauldron. “I am sure,” she said,
“that you were missing the cauldron.” “I was,” the housewife
replied, “not from any need I had of it at the time, but because
I did not know who the one was that took it away.” “I am
sure you did not know who took it,” said the one that came in,
“but I knew you too well; many a day you sang songs above
my house (<i>’s iomadh latha ’sheinn thu luinneag air mullach an
tigh agam</i>).” “Will you sit?” said the one who was spinning.
“I will sit and tell my story if you are sure that no one will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
come in while I am here.” As was customary in those days
the byre adjoined the dwelling-house, whatever kind of wall
(<i>sgàth-balla</i>) separated them, and one of the cows that had
calved and was in the byre, made a disturbance (<i>straighlich</i>).
The next look the woman took she was alone. On her
husband’s return, she said, “You may not leave me here alone;
one of the children must be left with me or I will be where
you are;” and she told him about the second time her strange
visitor came and how suddenly she had disappeared. The
goodman then went for advice to one, the minister, who he
knew was able to give him good counsel. On telling about the
undesirable visitor his wife had, the advice he got was that he
was to pull down his house as quickly as possible, and to put it
at the other end of the land; “and when you will pull down
your house, every particle (<i>h-uile pioc</i>) of the thatch that covers
it is to be burnt within the rafters on which nine cogfuls of sea-water
or charmed (<i>naoi cuachan sàile no uisge coisrigte</i>) is to be
poured.” The goodman returned home with this advice.
When his wife heard it she said that she must get women to
help her to finish the cloth she was working at, and it was agreed
to give her the help she required. On account of the dampness
of the houses the method of keeping the thread and wool dry
was by hanging them up to the rafters. Next morning the
goodwife missed a pile of wool from its place, but believing
that it was her son, who often played pranks on her, who had
removed it, she said nothing regarding its disappearance. Next
day, however, she was astonished at seeing her late strange
visitor with another and a taller one coming in. “I am sure,”
said the little redhued one, “you were missing the bag of wool
We took it with us to help you, and there it is brought home
made into thread, and your own thread that we took with us for
a pattern (<i>leth-bhreac</i>); and any time you have thread to spin,
we are ready to help you.” The goodwife was overcome with
fear and could not utter a word to them. They went away, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
she never saw themselves or their shadow (<i>an dubh no’n dath</i>)
ever afterwards. The house was taken down and another was
built where they chose it to be, but after some time an old man
saw five of the fairy company leaving the well at the foot of the
glen, each carrying a vessel full of water, and the place where
he saw them going in and lost sight of them, was afterwards
quarried, and the stone taken from it was employed to build a
church that stands at the present day. An opening that was
met with, in the quarry, where human bones were found, was
supposed to be the place where the fairy band entered their
dwelling.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_WISE_WOMAN_OF_DUNTULM_AND">THE WISE WOMAN OF DUNTULM AND
THE FAIRIES.</h3>
</div>


<p>A Lord of the Isles, MacConnal (<i>Buachaille nan Eileinean</i>),
long ago had two sons, but only one could get the estate at his
death. When that happened the eldest son said one day to the
youngest, “You are now left without anything, but, that you
may not be altogether portionless, go to Duntulm and you will
get there a piece of land that you will have to yourself.” The
lands of Duntulm, in the northern part of the Island of Skye,
were at that time occupied by a prosperous tenantry, consisting
chiefly of crofters and the holders of a few larger farms. The
youngest brother was told that the rent he would get from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
these tenants would maintain him, and he was to build a house
and marry a wife. He agreed to go to Duntulm, where he was
not a long time settled till a claim was made on his land for the
king’s dues, the crown tax being in proportion to the amount of
land which he held. The first time the tax (<i>a’ chìs</i>) was asked,
he said, in answer to the demand which was made, “I
will not pay any tax. Why should I pay it? What right has
the king to get it?” An order was sent to him every year for
payment of the tax, but if it was, for six years he did not pay
any of it (<i>cha do phàidh e sgillinn</i>). At last the king sent fifty
soldiers and one officer to take the rent from him in spite of
him (<i>thar ’amhaich</i>), and since he would pay to neither king
nor soldier, the lands were taken from him and they were now
attached to the crown. The king was receiving the revenue,
and a Skye carl (<i>bodach Sgitheanach</i>) called John Donaldson
MacWilliam (<i>Iain Mac Dhòmhnuil’ic Uilleim</i>) was appointed
a factor to collect the rents from the crofters. He lived sixteen
miles from Duntulm, among the crofts, where he went twice a
year to gather the tax. MacConnal’s castle was built on a
precipitous bank, on the west side of which there was a big pit
into which every high tide sent a flow of water that kept it
always full, forming a deep pool (<i>glumag</i>) that sometimes
proved dangerous to the unwary. One day it happened that
whatever a crofter, one Macrury, was doing at the castle, he
fell headlong into the pool, and however it was, whether he
was killed by the fall or drowned, he was found dead next day
anyhow. He left two sons who were not of age to help their
widowed mother, for whom much sympathy was felt by her
neighbours on account of her being left so helpless (<i>bha i air
a fàgail cho lom</i>). Next spring after this the two lads were
drowned in a boat with which they were bringing sea-ware
home, and being now alone she could not work her croft nor
pay her rent. When everything was spent, and she had only
one cow left of her fold of cattle, the factor came for the tax.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
On reaching the township he took with him a carle, friendly to
himself, to the widow’s house, where the neighbours had
gathered to ascertain the object of their visit. When the factor
was told that the poor woman had no means to pay her rent,
he asked if she had no cattle. She said that she had only one
cow and that it was grazing at some distance from the house.
He asked it to be brought where he was, and when he saw it
he said, “It is a pity there are not more of the kind.” Being
the only one, it had got all the attention and was in good
condition. She said she had no other. He said, “We will
keep this one for the dues.” It was taken away from the
widow and put in a field that was surrounded by a stone wall,
near the castle, along with the small red pony which the factor
had with him. While he was in search of some one to drive it
away, and taking his dinner in the carle’s house, the young men
of Duntulm climbed over the wall of the field, though high,
and got out the animals, which they drove to the shore, where
a boat was in readiness in which they were taken to the islet of
Fladda (<i>Fladda ’chuain</i>), two miles off. The men put them
ashore there, and had their boat drawn up in Duntulm Bay
before the factor and his companion returned to look for their
property and found the park empty. On asking the men, who
had again gathered, if they knew how the animals had escaped
or where they were, they said there was no gap in the wall
known to them, and that the only person likely to know of
their whereabouts was a gifted woman who lived near the castle,
in search of whom two of them went. They found her at
home, on reaching the height where her house was, and told
her all that had occurred, and how she was to go with them and
say that the cattle had been charmed away to some wonderful
place. Isabel said that she was not well prepared to go that
day. The men asked what preparation she lacked (<i>’dé an cion
dòigh a bh’ oirre</i>). She then asked for one of the men’s broad
bonnets, and when she got it, rose, and leaving her hair, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
was becoming grey, streaming over her shoulders, she put it on,
and tying a goatskin round her, tying her shoes and making
garters with stripes of the same fur, she put a rope of straw
round her waist and took a large staff in her hand. “She is
prepared at last, and come now,” the men said. When she
came in sight, the factor looked at her in amazement, for he
had never before seen a creature of her appearance. Before
she came near he called, “Wife, do you know where the horse
and cow I put in the park are now?” She paid no attention
to him, but kept on coming nearer (<i>cha do lag i air a ceum</i>),
till she stood at his shoulder. “To whom did the animals
belong?” she asked him then. “The cow belonged to the
king,” he said, “and the horse to myself.” “How could a cow
belonging to the king be in this township?” she asked. “This
woman gave it to me for the tax,” he said, pointing to the
widow. “She did not give it to you; she said you took it with
you; and it is now that I understand the meaning of what
happened when I was in my own house to-day, and heard an
uproar (<i>straighlich</i>) in the air above that was greater than any
one could ever have heard, and on looking for the cause of it,
there it was in a fire; and though all the fires that you ever saw
were gathered together, they would not make one like it; and
in the last of the fire (<i>’an earball an teine</i>) I looked to see what
there was, and what was there but a horse and cow, while there
were as good as five thousand little men, the hill men (<i>muinntir
nan cnoc</i>), who were not larger than bottles, going on, on each
side of the fire; and if you had as much knowledge of the
dwellers of these hills as I have, you would not touch the
widow’s portion, but if you are anxious to get back the animals&mdash;there
before you, is the hill where they are, and where you
can go and seek them, and if you can, find them.” The man,
who was terrified by her appearance and words, kept looking
at her (<i>’g a feitheamh</i>) and always drawing a step further off.
He went home without horse or cow, and however long he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
remained in the office he held, the fear of the wise woman,
(<i>Iseabal N’ic Rao’uill</i>) and the fairies kept him from ever
returning to Duntulm. When he was out of sight of the township,
the young men of Duntulm went to the islet where they
left the animals, which they brought back and gave to the poor
woman, who was then able to pay the tax.</p>

</div>


<p class="p1_5">In early times, long ago, (<i>’an toiseach an t-saoghail, o chionn
nan cian</i>), it is said that the island of Mull was uninhabited
except by a few families who were living, on the south side at
Carsaig, in that part of the island known as the Ross of Mull.
These families lived isolated from the rest of the world; none
of them had ever seen any one from anywhere else there, and
none of themselves had ever left the place. They had no
boats, and they said the other islets and land that they were
seeing opposite were other worlds. One day, then, they saw
coming on the sea before them (<i>mu’n comhair</i>) from the mainland
a speck (<i>dùradan</i>), and when it came near they compared
it to a horse with a tree standing on its back, but when it came
to the shore it was a boat made of wicker-work covered with
hides, with one man in it, who had some drink with him, and
a quantity of hazel nuts for food. On account of his boat
being covered with hides<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, they named him “The cowhide
man, (<i>am boicionnach</i>). On landing, he told them how he had
left home, out of curiosity to see other places, and that was the
first place he was able to reach. He is said to have come from
Ardencaple in the district of Lorn on the mainland (<i>Ard-nan-capull,
’an Lathurna</i>.) He stayed a long time with them, as
they treated him kindly, being much pleased with him. He
taught them new ways that were useful to them in their every-day
life, and by his skill and knowledge promoted their welfare
in many ways. On seeing that they were not utilizing the milk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
of their cows and goats by making cheese from it, he asked
them the reason of this. They told him that they did not know
what cheese was, as they had never heard of it nor seen it, and
would like well to know how it was made. They had the art
of making butter among them previous to his coming. He took
in <i>Lus-buidhe-bealltainn</i>, (marsh marigold) and putting its stalks
in the milk turned it to curds and whey. This is said to be the
first cheese that was made in Mull. Some time, nearly a year
after this, another boat, or, as they described it, a horse with a
tree in its back, was seen coming in the same way. This one
came ashore at Lochspelvie, further eastward, and had one man
in it also, whom they named “The one in the skin coverings”
(<i>an craicionnach</i>). He was brother to the one who came before,
and had come in search of him. The two strangers and the
natives were agreeing well together, and the brothers began to
build a boat when they found wood abundant in Mull. When
the boat was finished they named it “the six-oared boat”
(<i>iùrach nan sia ràmh</i>), and when it was fitted up and made
ready for sailing, the two brothers took a crew with them and
set off in it, to go to one or other of the worlds (<i>na saoghalan
eile</i>) that they were seeing before them, and reached Jura
(<i>Diùra</i>), but the natives of the island would not let them land,
as they had never seen a boat before. They stoned them away
from the shore. They then went to Colonsay, but the Colonsay
men (<i>na Colosaich</i>) were equally hard-hearted (<i>doirbh</i>). They
attacked them, and tried to blind them by throwing sand
about their eyes. It was then that they went on to the green
(<i>lit.</i>, blue) island (<i>an t-eilean gorm</i>), the name by which Islay
was then known, where they arrived at a more favourable time,
no one being before them at the shore. They drew the boat
up on the land, and went on to see if there were people to be
found on the island or if they would meet with anyone who
could direct them to a house. The first person they met was
an old man who was watching cattle (<i>aig aire sreud</i>). He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
thought they belonged to the island, as no one was known to
have ever come to or gone away from it. The first of the
brothers who came, asked the old man to give him information
about the place. The old man remarked, “How curious your
speech is, if you were born in this island.” He said, “No, I
am not a native of this island.” The old man said, “And if
not, what has brought you here?” “The reason of my coming
is, to ask what you can give, and give what I may.” The
old man then, as it was nightfall, kindled a fire, and they
sat with him till daylight, when men and houses were
to be seen. The Islay men were hospitable to the
strangers, who remained a full year and built seven boats
for them. The elder brother married a woman of the country,
and after some time he thought of returning to Mull again.
Having prepared his boat he set off, taking his wife and the
others with him, and set his course northwards (<i>aghaidh a
bhàta, tuath</i>). They had not gone far when a thick mist came
on which darkened their world, and as they had no compass and
could see no land, they drifted till the boat went in to a shore.
This was the first appearance of land they saw since leaving the
<i>Eilean Gorm</i>. A big man came down where they were&mdash;they
never saw his equal for size&mdash;and he caught the fore part of the
boat and drew it up above high water mark, with them all in it.
He invited them to go to his house. They went with him and
were made welcome. The daughter of the house, on being
asked by the elder of the two brothers for a drink, brought a
a two-hooped wooden dish full of milk, set it on the floor beside
them and went away. One of the strangers rose to lift the dish
and he could not. Then three of them rose, but it defied them
to lift it. She came back, and finding the dish as she left it,
said, “If you have quenched your thirst it is not awanting from
the measure (<i>air a’ mheasair</i>)”. The cowhide one replied, “We
have not been accustomed to stoop like cattle (<i>cromadh mar
bhà</i>) when we take a drink, and we could not lift the dish.” At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
that she caught the wooden dish by the ear, in her left hand,
and held the drink to them all. “Where have you come from,”
she said, “or where are you going?” “We came from the
dark-blue sea-isle,” he said, “and are going to the hilly isle (<i>do
’n eilean bheannach</i>).” “That is Mull,” she said, “Mull of my
love, Mull of little men (<i>Muile mo ghràidh, Muile nam fear
beaga</i>).” They passed that night cheerfully together, and went
to put off to sea next day; but when they tried to move the
boat and get it afloat, they might as well attempt to move the
Rhinns of Islay (<i>an Roinn Ileach</i>) they could not move it.
The young wife who came with them from Islay said then, “I
know where we are; we are in the green isle that is under
spells (<i>fo gheasaibh</i>), but I have a gift that will let us leave it,”
and she told those with her how her mother had at parting
given her a cap, saying, “If you are ever in a strait, put it on,
and you must at the same time bend your head to the ground
as low as your feet seven times (<i>seachd uairean do shròn a
bhualadh ri òrdaig do choise</i>).” She had the cap in her belt
(<i>’n a cneas</i>), and she told them to sit in the boat and take the
oars. She then stood in their midst, touched the cap, bent her
head, and it went up to her breast (<i>an cneas</i>); the next time it
went up to her neck (<i>am muineal</i>); the third time, to her chin,
(<i>an smigead</i>); then, as she bent her head, at the fourth time, it
went up past her mouth to her nose; the next time, it reached
her eyes, then her forehead, at last the top of her head, and the
boat was off. The mist was still there. They asked the eldest
brother in which direction they were to set their course. He
told them to follow the flight of birds, as they went shorewards
in the evening and would guide them to land. There is a
saying about the home-coming of birds and fish, that “Birds of
the universe go westward, and fish of the deep eastward (<i>Eòin
an domhain, siar, ’s iasg an domhain, sear</i>).” During the night,
the younger brother, the one of skins, called out that there
was a mound before them (<i>gu ’n robh tòrr rompa</i>). His brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
who was in the afterpart of the boat said, “Is it a tòrr without
grass,” and it has got the name of Torrens to the present day
(<i>’se na tòrrain a theirear riu gus an là ’n diugh</i>). They reached
Mull shore when it was day, and they ran-in the boat at a
narrow strait that was like an opening in a dyke (<i>cachaileith
ghàraidh</i>), and before they got them from the tholepins, the
oars were broken. The place is still known as the narrow strait
of broken oars (<i>Caolas-a’-bhristidh-ràmh</i>). They got on shore,
and went home and told where they had been and what had
happened to them.</p>

<p>The person, now above 70 years of age, from whom the
above story was taken down almost word for word by the
writer, said that he heard the story when he was a young man,
and that the following story (that of the two sisters), was a
continuation of it; the incidents of the story occurred during
the absence of the two brothers from the place, and were told
to them by the natives, in return for the story of their own
adventures. The name Torquil, which occurs in this story,
and the belief in witchcraft and occult power indicated,
suggests that the colony in Mull came originally from Lochlin,
or that the story belongs to a later period of history than that
that of “The two brothers.” The story is as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<p>Two sisters were living in the same township on the south side
of Mull. One of them who was known as Lovely <i>Mairearad</i><a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
had a fairy sweetheart, who came where she was, unknown to
anyone, until one day she confided the secret to her sister, who
was called Ailsa<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> (<i>Ealasaid</i>), and told her how she dearly loved
her fairy sweetheart. “And now, sister,” she said, “you will
not tell any one.” “No,” her sister answered, “I will not tell
any one; that story will as soon pass from my lips as it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
from my knee (<i>o’m ghlùn</i>)”; but she did not keep her promise;
she told the secret of the fairy sweetheart to others, and when
he came again, he found that he was observed, and he went
away and never returned, nor was he seen or heard of ever after
by any one in the place. When the lovely sister came to know
this, she left her home and became a wanderer among the hills
and hollows, and never afterwards came inside of a house door,
to stand or sit down, while she lived. Those who herded
cattle (<i>ag uallach threud</i>) tried frequently to get near her and
persuade her to return home, but they never succeeded further
than to hear her crooning a melancholy song in which she told
how her sister had been false to her, and that the wrong done
to her would be avenged on the sister or her descendants, if a
fairy (<i>neach sìth</i>) has power. On hearing that Ailsa was
married, she repeated, “Dun Ailsa is married and has a son
Torquil, and the evil will be avenged on her or on him (<i>phòs,
phòs Ealasaid Odhar,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> &amp;c.</i>).” What she hummed in her
mournful song was:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whatever gifts the brown-haired only child of her sister was
favoured with, besides others, he was a noted reaper, but this
gift proved fatal to him (<i>dh’ fhòghainn e dha</i>). When he grew
up to manhood, he could reap as much as seven men, and none
among them could compete with him. He was then told that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
a strange woman was seen coming to the harvest fields in
autumn, after the reapers had left, and that she would reap a
field before daylight next morning, or any part of the ripe corn
that the reapers could not finish that day, and in whatever field
she began, she left the work of seven reapers, finished, after
her. She was known as the Maiden of the Cairn (<i>Gruagach<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
a’ chùirn</i>), from being seen to come out of a cairn over opposite.
One evening then, brown-haired Torquil, who desired to see her
at work, being later than usual of returning home, on looking
back saw her beginning in his own field. He returned, and
finding his sickle where he had put it away, he took it with him,
and after her he went. He resolved to overtake her and began
to reap the next furrow, saying, “You are a good reaper or I
will overtake you;” but the harder he worked, the more he saw
that instead of getting nearer to her, she was drawing further
away from him, and he then called out to her,</p>

<p>“Maiden of the cairn, wait for me, wait for me.” (<i>’Ghruagach
a’ chùirn, fuirich rium, fuirich rium.</i>)</p>

<p>She said, answering him,</p>

<p>“Handsome brown-haired youth, overtake me, overtake me.”
(<i>’Fhleasgaich a’ chuil-duinn, beir orm, beir orm.</i>)</p>

<p>He was confident that he would overtake her, and went on
after her till the moon was darkened by a cloud; he then
called to her,</p>

<p>“The moon is clouded (<i>lit.</i> smothered by a cloud), delay,
delay.” (<i>Tha ’ghealach air a mùchadh fo neòil, fuirich rium,
fuirich rium.</i>)</p>

<p>“I have no other light but her, overtake me, overtake me,”
she said.</p>

<p>He did not, nor could he, overtake her, and on seeing again
how far she was in advance of him, he said, “I am weary with
yesterday’s reaping, wait for me, wait for me.” She answered,
“I ascended the round hill of steep summits (<i>màm cas nan
leac</i>), overtake me, overtake me;” but he could not. He then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
said, “My sickle would be the better of being sharpened (<i>air a
bhleath</i>), wait for me, wait for me.” She answered, “My sickle
will not cut garlic, overtake me, overtake me.” At this she
reached the head of the furrow, finished reaping, and stood
still where she was, waiting for him. When he reached the
head of his own furrow, he caught the last handful of corn,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
to keep it, as was the custom, it being the “Harvest Maiden”
(<i>a’ mhaighdean-bhuana</i>), and stood with it in one hand and the
sickle in the other. Looking at her steadily in the face, he
said,</p>

<p>“You have put the old woman far from me, and it is not my
displeasure you deserve.” (<i>Chuir thu a’ chailleach fada uam ’s
cha b’ e mo ghruaim a thoill thu.</i>)<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>She said,</p>

<p>“It is an evil thing early on Monday to reap the harvest
maiden.” (<i>’S dona ’n ni</i> (var., <i>mì-shealbhach</i>) <i>moch Di-luain
dol a bhuain maighdein.</i>)</p>

<p>On her saying this, he fell dead on the field and never more
drew breath. The Maiden of the Cairn was never afterwards
seen, nor heard of; and that was how the sister’s wishes ended.</p>

THE DARK, OR PITCH-PINE, DAUGHTER OF THE NORSE KING,<br />

<span class="smcap p85">And how she thinned the Woods of Lochaber.</span></h3>
</div>


<p class="p1_5">When the Norsemen came, and their visits were frequent and
numerous, to this country and these islands, to lay claim to
and take possession of the land, the fame they gathered for
themselves through their indulgence in every manner of cruel
spoliation, and slaughter of the people wherever they landed,
was that they were a bold, courageous, hardy, rough (“The
Norsemen a rough band”), peremptory and unscrupulous race,
and more than that, it was attributed to them that they practised
witchcraft, charms, and enchantments, and had much of other
unhallowed learning among them. The Norse King’s eldest
daughter was particularly noted for her knowledge of the
“Black Art.” There was no accident or mischance that befell
friends, or destruction that overtook enemies, or any luck or
good fortune that attended either friend or foe, but it was said
that she was the cause of it, or had some hand in it. She was
famed at home and abroad, far and wide, for her skill among
cows and cattle, she was said to possess every variety of dairy
knowledge in her father’s kingdom. There was no charm or
evil eye that fell on any living creature in the fold but she
could dispel and avert, nor hurt nor injury they got but she
could heal, nor dizziness nor fits into which they fell, from
which she could not restore them, until it was said of her that
the lowing of cattle, the incoherent cry of calves, and the rough
cry of yearlings was to her the sweetest and most soothing
music, and that she would answer the call of cattle, though she
might be lost in the midst of the northern woods, and the cry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
from the nethermost part of the farthest off quarter of the
universe. She knew the herb that had the property of taking
its qualities from milk, as well as she was acquainted with the
spells by which its virtues could be restored, and every charm
and invocation that was practised or then esteemed. The
flowers of the meadows and woods were as familiar to her as
the ridges of corn or a grain on straw, and there was not a leaf
on tree, bush, or shrub, with whose properties she was not
acquainted. Her father’s kingdom was clothed with pine
wood, and was then as now famous for the fine quality of the
wood from which most of the wealth of the kingdom was
obtained.</p>

<p>One of those times when the Norsemen came to Scotland to
take possession of and sub-divide the land thus taken, they
observed that the pine wood of Lochaber was growing so fast,
and extending so far, that in time it might supersede the Black
Forests of Sweden. But on this occasion the northern forces
were driven back. On reaching home they reported the matter
to the king, and their opinion, that the increase of the wood
must be checked, otherwise his northern woods would be of
little esteem.</p>

<p>It occurred to the King to consult his daughter on the
matter, since she was learned, and to get knowledge from her
of the best method of thinning and destroying the Scottish
wood. She gave him the desired information, but said that
she must be the bearer of the method and must necessarily go
to Scotland herself. She obtained the King’s permission and
made preparations for the journey.</p>

<p>From the gifts she possessed, neither sea nor land, air nor
earth could hinder her progress until she accomplished her
purpose. When she reached Lochaber the method she adopted
was to kindle a fire in the selvage of her dress, and she then
began to go through the woods, and as she could travel in the
clouds as well as on the ground, when she ascended and whirled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
in the air, the sparks of fire that flew from her dress were blown
hither and thither by the wind and set the woods on fire, until
the whole country was almost in a blaze, and so darkened by
the smoke, that one could hardly see before them; and,
from being blackened more than any tree in the forest, by the
smoke and soot of the fiery furnace which surrounded her, she
was known and spoken of by the name of “Dark, or Pitch
Pine.” The people gathered to watch her, but from the
rapidity of her ascent and the swiftness with which she
descended, they could not grasp her any more than they could
prevent her, and were at a loss what to do. At last, they
sought instruction from a learned man in the place. He
advised them to collect a herd of cattle in a fold, wherever she
would stand still, and whenever she heard the lowing of the
cattle she would descend, and when she was within gun-shot
they were to fire at her with a silver bullet, when she would
become a faggot of bones. They followed this advice and
began to gather cattle and follow after her until the pinfold
large and small was full set in the “Centre of Kintail.”
Whenever she heard the cry of the herd she descended and
they aimed at her with the silver bullet, as the wise man told
them to do, and she fell gently among them. Men lifted the
remains and carried them to Lochaber, and to make sure that
dead or alive she would do no more injury to them, they buried
her in Achnacarry; and the person from whom the story was
first heard nine years ago [1880] said that he could put his foot
on the place where she was buried.</p>

<p>The Norse King was amazed at his daughter not returning,
and at his not receiving any account from her. He sent abroad
to get tidings of her. When the news of the disaster that
happened to her was brought to him, he sent a boat and crew
to bring her home, but the Lochaber women by their incantations
destroyed those whom he sent. The boat was wrecked,
and the men lost, at the entrance to Locheil. The next ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
that came were not more successful. The third time the King
sent out his most powerful fleet. What they did then was to
send and try through spells to dry up the wells of the Fairy Hill
of Iona. The virtue of these wells was that wind could be
obtained from any desired quarter by emptying them in the
direction of the wind wished for. When the ships were seen
approaching, the wells began to be emptied, and before the last
handful was flung out, the storm was so violent, and the ships
so near, that the whole fleet was driven on the beach under the
Fairy Hill, and the power and might of the Norsemen was
broken and so much weakened that they did not return again
to infest the land.</p>

<p>Mar thàinig na Lochlannaich an toiseach, ’s bu bhitheanta sin,
air feadh nan dùthchannan ’s nan eileinean so, a thogail
chòraichean ’s a ghabhail sealbh air fearann, ’s e an cliù a
choisinn iad dhaibh féin, leis gu ’n robh iad ris a h-uile seòrsa
léir-chreach ’s milleadh air muinntir nan àiteachan a bha iad
a’ ruigheachd, gu ’n robh iad ’n an daoine dalma, misneachail,
cruaidh-chridheach, borb. “Lochlannaich, a’ bhuidheann
bhorb,” neo-easmaileach, neo-thròcaireach ’s a thuilleadh air
sin, bha e air chur as an leth gu ’n robh buidseachd agus
druidheachd ’s iomadh eòlas toirmisgte eile ’n am measg.</p>

<p>Bha ’n nighean a bu sine aig Righ Lochlainn sònraichte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
ainmeil air son na bh’ aice de ’n “Sgoil Dubh.” Cha robh
sgiorradh no tubaist a thachaireadh do chàirdean, no sgrios a
thigeadh air naimhdean, no math no rath a dh’ éireadh do h-aon
diù, nach robh e air a ràdhainn gur i b’ aobhar-cinn dha, no
gu ’n robh làmh thaobh-eiginn aice ann. Bha i aig an tigh ’s
uaithe fada ’s farsuinn comharraichte air son sgil am measg
cruidh ’s feudail; ’s ann aice bha gach seòrsa eòlas cruidh ’an
rìoghachd a h-athar. Cha robh sian no sùil a laidheadh air
creutair beo ’s a’ bhuaile nach togadh i, no tuaineal no ceangal
’s an rachadh iad nach fhuasgladh i, gus an abairteadh gur e
geumnaich cruidh, blaomannaich laogh agus ràcaireachd
ghamhna an t-aon cheòl cadail a bu bhinn leatha, ’s gu ’m
freagradh i ’n uair a chluinneadh i ’n spréidh ged bhiodh i ’n a
suain an teis-meadhon coille dhubh a h-athar ’s an geum o
cheann ìochdar iomall an domhain.</p>

<p>B’ aithne dh’ i an lus a bheireadh an toradh as a’ bhainne co
math ’s a b’ aithne dh’ i na h-eòlais a thilleadh air ais e, agus
gach seòrsa sian agus oradh a bha air a chleachdainn no air a
chunntas feumail ’s an àm. Bha gach luibh ’s a’ mhachair no
’s a’ choille co-ionnan dh’ i ri arbhar nan imirean no spilgean
cònlaich, ’s cha robh duilleag air craoibh, no preas, no dris,
nach b’ aithne dh’ i. ’S an àm so bha dùthaich a h-athar còmhdaichte
le coille ghiubhais, agus iomraideach (mar tha fhathast)
air son co math ’s a bha a fiodh, ’s bha neart de bheartais na
rìoghachd ’tighinn a stigh air a tailibh.</p>

<p>Uair de na h-uairean sin thàinig na Lochlannaich do Albainn
a thoirt a mach fearainn ’s a dheanamh roinn na còrach air na
gheibheadh iad, ’s thug iad fainear gu ’n robh coille ghiubhais
Lochabair a’ fàs ’s a’ gabhail roimpe co mòr ’s gu ’m faodtadh
e ’bhi gu ’n cuireadh i stad air coille dhubh na Suain. Chaidh
feachd Lochlannach an uair so thilleadh air ais an taobh a
thàinig iad, ’s ’n uair a ràinig iad dhachaidh dh’ innis iad do ’n
righ mar bha iad ’am beachd a thachradh ’s gu ’m feumadh stad
a chur air cinneas na coille Albanaich neo nach bitheadh mòran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
meas air a’ chonnadh aige-san. ’S e smuaintich an righ bho ’n
a bha h-uile ionnsachadh aig a nighean gu ’n cuireadh e ’chomhairle
rithe, ’s gu ’m faigheadh e fiosrachadh uaipe ’d e an dòigh
a b’ fhearr ’s a bu luaithe air a’ choille Albanaich a dheanamh

aice fhéin ri dol ann. Fhuair i cead o ’n Rìgh, ’s rinn i deas
air son falbh; ’s leis na cumhachdan a bh’ aice cha chuireadh
muir no tìr, talamh no adhar, stad air a ceum gus an ruigeadh
i ceann thall a’ ghnothaich.</p>

<p>’N uair a ràinig i Lochabair ’s e ’n dòigh a ghabh i, dh’
fhadaidh i teine ’an iomall a gùin ’s ghabh i gu siubhal roimh

Ghiùbhsach” a theireadh iad rithe.</p>

<p>Bha muinntir na dùthcha cruinn còmhla ’g a feitheamh ’s cha
chumadh iad sealladh oirre leis co àrd ’s a rachadh i anns na

bha ’s an dùthaich. Thuirt esan riu, buaile cruidh a chruinneachadh
far an stadadh i, ’s ’n uair a chluinneadh i ’n fheudail
’s a’ bhuar gu ’n tèarnadh i; ’s an uair a bhiodh i mar urchair

<p>Bha ioghnadh air Righ Lochlainn nach robh a nighean a’
tilleadh no sgeul uaipe. Chuir e forfhais a mach, ’s trà chualaic
e mar thachair dhi, chuir e bàta ’s sgioba air son a toirt dachaidh,
ach dh’ fhoghain mnathan Lochabair le ’n ubagan dh’ i.
Chaidh a briste ’s na daoine chall, aig bun Lochiall. Cha d’
ràinig an ath chabhlach na bu mhò. ’S an treasa uair trà chuir
an Righ mach feachd na rioghachd ’s e rinn iadsan, chuir iad

co dlùth ’s gu ’n do bhrisdeadh iad air cladach an Dùin,
’s chaidh cumhachd ’s feachd nan Lochlannach lughdachadh co

<h3 class="nobreak mb0" id="ONEIL" title="HOW O’NEIL’S HAIR WAS MADE TO GROW.">O’NEIL,<br />

<span class="p85">AND HOW THE HAIR OF HIS HEAD WAS MADE TO GROW.</span></h3>
</div>


<p class="p1_5">There was a smith, before now, in Ireland, who was one day
working in the smithy, when a youth came in, having two old
women with him.</p>

<p>He said to the smith,</p>

<p>“I would be obliged to you,” he said, “if you would let me
have a while at the bellows and anvil.”</p>

<p>The smith said he would. He then caught the two old
women, threw a hoop about their middle, and placed them in
the smithy fire, and blew the bellows at them, and then took
them out and made one woman, the fairest that eye ever saw,
from the two old women.</p>

<p>When the smith laid down at night, he said to his wife,</p>

<p>“A man came the way of the smithy to-day, having with him
two old women; he asked from me a while of the bellows
and anvil, and he made the fairest woman that man’s eye ever
saw, out of the two old women. My own mother and your
mother are here with us, and I think I will try to make one
right woman of the two since I saw the other man doing it.”</p>

<p>“Do,” she said, “I am quite willing.”</p>

<p>Next day he took out the two old women, put the hoop about
their middle, and threw them in the smithy fire. It was not
long before it became likely that he would not have even the
bones of them left. The smith was in extremity, not knowing
what to do, but a voice came behind him,</p>

<p>“You are perplexed, smith, but perhaps I will put you right.”
With that he caught the bellows and blew harder at them; he
then took them out and put them on the anvil, and made as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
fair a woman out of the two old wives. Then he said to the
smith,</p>

<p>“You had need of me to-day, but,” said he, “you better
engage me; I will not ask from you but the half of what I
earn, and that this will be in the agreement, that I shall have the
third of my own will.” The smith engaged him.</p>

<p>At this time O’Neil sent abroad word that he wanted one
who would make the hair of his head to grow, for there was
none on the head of O’Neil or O’Donnell, his brother, and that
whoever could do it, would get the fourth part of his means.
The servant lad said to the smith,</p>

<p>“We had better go and make a bargain with O’Neil that we
will put hair on his head,” and they did this. “Say you to
him,” said the servant lad, “that you have a servant who will
put hair on his head for the fourth part of what he possesses.”</p>

<p>O’Neil was agreeable to this, and the servant lad desired to
get a room for themselves, and asked a cauldron to be put on
a good fire. It was done as he wished. O’Neil was taken in
and stretched on a table. The servant lad then took hold of
the axe, threw off O’Neil’s head, and put it face foremost in the
cauldron. After some time he took hold of a large prong which he
had, and he lifted up the head with it, and hair was beginning
to come upon it. In a while he lifted it up again with the
same prong, this time a ply of the fine yellow hair would go
round his hand. Then he gave the head such a lift, and stuck
it on the body. O’Neil then called out to him to make haste
and let him rise to his feet, when he saw the fine yellow hair
coming in into his eyes. He did as he had promised; he gave
the smith and the servant lad the fourth part of his possessions.
When they were going home with the cattle the servant lad said
to the smith,</p>

<p>“We are now going to separate, we will make two halves or
divisions of the cattle.”</p>

<p>The smith was not willing to agree to this, but since it was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
his bargain he got the one half. They then parted, and the
animal the smith would not lose now, he would lose again, he
did not know where he was going before he reached home, and
he had only one old cow that he did not lose of the cattle.</p>

<p>When O’Donnell saw his brother’s hair, he sent out word
that he would give the third part of his property to any one
who would do the same to himself. The smith thought he
would try to do it this time alone. He went where O’Donnell
was, and said to him that he would put hair on his head for
him also, as he had done to his brother O’Neil. Then he asked
that the cauldron be put on, and a good fire below it, and he
took O’Donnell into a room, tied him on a table, then took up
an axe, cut off his head, and threw it, face downwards, into the
cauldron. In a while he took the prong to see if the hair was
growing, but instead of the hair growing, the jaws were nearly
falling out. The smith was almost out of his senses, not
knowing what to do, when he heard a voice behind him saying
to him, “You are in a strait.” This was the lad with the Black
Art, he formerly had, returned. He blew at the cauldron
stronger, brought the prong to see how the head was doing, or
if the hair was growing on it. The next time he tried it, it
would twine round his hand. Since it was so long of growing
on it, he said, “We will put an additional fold round my hand.”
When he tried it again it would reach two twists. He took it
out of the cauldron and stuck it on the body. It cried to be
quickly let go, when he saw his yellow hair down on his
shoulders. The hair pleased him greatly; it was more abundant
than that of O’Neil, his brother. They got fully what was
promised them, and were going on their way home. The lad
who had the Black Art said, “Had we not better divide the
cattle?”</p>

<p>“We will not, we will not,” said the smith, “lift them with
you, since I got clear.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other, “if you had said that before, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
would not have gone home empty-handed, or with only one
cow,” and with that he said, “You will take every one of them:
I will take none of them.”</p>

<p>The smith went home with that herd, and he did not require
to strike a blow in his smithy, neither did he meet with the one
with the Black Art, ever after.</p>

<p>Gobhainn bh’ ann roimhe so ann an Eirinn, ’s bha e latha de

<p>“Dean,” ars’ ise, “tha mi làn-toileach.”</p>

<p>Am màireach thug e mach an dà chaillich ’s chuir e ’n cearcall
mu ’m meadhon, ’s thilg e ’s an teallach iad. Cha b’ fhada ach

mach iad a sin ’s chuir e air an innean iad, ’s rinn e boirionnach
a bu bhriadha de ’n dà chaillich. Thuirt e sin ris a’ ghobhainn,
“Bha feum agad ormsa an diugh, ach,” ars’ esan, “’s ann a ’s

<p>Aig an àm sin chuir O’ Neil mach fios na ’m faigheadh e fear

air O’ Domhnull a bhràthair, gu ’n toireadh e dhoibh a’ cheathramh

thuirt an gille ris a’ ghobhainn, “gu bheil gille agadsa a chuireas
falt air, air son a’ cheathramh chuid d’ a mhaoin.”</p>

<p>Bha O’ Neil deònach air a shon so, agus dh’ iarr an gille

<p>’N uair bha iad so ’dol dachaidh’s an spréidh aca, thuirt an

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_WOLF_AND_THE_FOX">THE WOLF AND THE FOX.</h3>
</div>


<p>This story, like many others in which the lower animals figure
as characters, is very popular in the Highlands, in fact, Mr.
Campbell of Islay, by whom it is mentioned, could not help
falling in with it. But the version published by him is destitute
of several interesting incidents which form a part of the
story. The narration depends always upon the knowledge and
skill of the person who tells it, and this edition is given because
there is to be found in it incidents of much interest and amusement,
not to be found in any other version, such as the Fox’s
oath and standing in front of the fire. The Gaelic is not given
except in the essential expressions, and it is not deemed of
much consequence to give more, as their fluency and number
depend upon the reciter’s knowledge and tact. In these fables
the lower animals appear with the same characteristics as are
always assigned to them, and in this tale the fox appears as
not only wily and cunning, but also as the most unprincipled
scoundrel, indifferent to the interests of others, and also to
what is usually of weight with men, the restraint of an unseen
power.</p>

<p>The Fox and Wolf were keeping house together near the
shore, and as might naturally be expected, were very poor and
at times hard up for food. At first the fox kept himself in
good condition, and was not so voracious as the wolf. After
a heavy storm in winter time the two went along the shore
to see what the sea had cast up. This is still done by poor
people in the islands, and in those places where wood does not
grow. They are often fortunate enough to find logs and planks
of wood. On the occasion of the wolf and the fox’s journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
they were fortunate enough to find a keg of butter. Probably
it had come from Ireland and been swept or thrown overboard
in the storm. It was particularly welcome to the poor finders,
and the rascally fox at once coveted it for himself. He said
to the wolf that, as this was the winter time, they had not so
much need of it, but when the hungry summer (<i>samhradh
gortach</i>) would come, it would be doubly welcome; they had
better bury it, and no one would know of its existence but
themselves. They dug a deep hole, buried the keg of butter,
and went home with their other provisions. Some days after
that the fox came in, and wearily throwing himself on a settle,
or seat, which formed part of the furniture, he heaved a deep
sigh and said, “Alas! Alas! Woe is me (<i>Och! Och! fhéin
thall</i>).”</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas!” said the sympathising wolf, “what is it that
troubles you?”</p>

<p>“Dear me,” said the fox, “they are wanting me out to a
christening (<i>Och! Och! tha iad ’gam iarraidh mach gu goisteachd</i>),”
still pretending a weary indifference, and the Gaelic
expression is here noticeable, as, being asked out to a baptism
means literally being asked to be god-father, or gossip at the
baptism, a practise observed in the Highlands, even where the
Roman Catholic and Episcopal systems have disappeared.</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas!” said the wolf, “are you going?”</p>

<p>“Alas! Alas!” said the fox, “I am.” When he came
home, the wolf asked what name they had given the child.
“A queer enough name,” said the fox, “<i>Blaiseam</i>,” (let me
taste).</p>

<p>Some days after that again the same manœuvre was gone
through, and when the fox returned and the wolf asked him
the child’s name, he said it was as queer a name as the former
one,&mdash;“<i>Bi ’na mheadhon</i>,” (be in its middle). A third time
the manœuvre was gone through and the child’s name was said
to be the queerest of all, “<i>Sgrìob an clàr</i>,” (scrape the stave).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>At last the “hungry summer” came; and it was such as is
well known even in eastern countries when the stores of the
preceding harvest are exhausted, and the stores of the year’s
harvest are not yet ready. The fox and the wolf went for the
keg of butter, but it had disappeared. The fox being prepared
for this emergency began at once to accuse the wolf of having
taken it, “No one knew it was there but our two selves, and I
see the colour of it on your fur.”</p>

<p>The two went away home, the wolf very much cast down,
and the fox persisting in his accusation that the wolf had stolen
it. The wolf solemnly protested that he had never touched it.</p>

<p>“Will you swear then?” the fox said.</p>

<p>According to a Highland proverb, protestations may be loud
till they are solemn oaths (<i>’S mòr facal gu lùghadh</i>). The wolf
then held up its paw, and with great solemnity emitted this
oath, “If it be that I stole the butter, and it be, and it be,
may disease lie heavy on my grey belly in the dust, in the dust,”
(<i>Ma ’s mise ghoid an t-ìm, ’s gur mi, ’s gur mi, Galar trom-ghlas
air mo bhronnghlas anns an ùir, anns an ùir</i>).</p>

<p>“Swear now yourself,” but the fox was so impressed by the
dignity and reverence of the oath, that he tried every means in
his power to evade so solemn an ordeal; but the wolf would
take no refusal, and at last the fox emitted this oath, “If it be
I that stole the butter, and it be, and it be, Whirm, Wheeckam,
Whirram, Whycam Whirrim Whew, Whirrim Whew,” (<i>Ma’s
mise ’ghoid an t-ìm ’s gur a mi, ’s gur a mi, ciream, cìceam ciream
cuaigeam, ciream ciu, ciream ciu</i>). The student of language will
observe how the Gaelic C corresponds to the English Wh. This
is particularly noticeable here as the difference renders the
oath as ludicrous in the translation as in the original, if not more
so. The wolf said nothing, but the fox, with that persistence
which often accompanies evil-doing, suggested that they should
both stand in front of the fire and whoever began to sweat first
would be the guilty party, as the butter would be oozing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
through him. The wolf thinking no evil, consented, and the
fox thought he would get him to stand nearer to the fire than
himself. It so turned out however, that the fox, who had kept
himself in good condition by repeated visits to the keg of butter,
(and they must have been more frequent than the baptisms to
which he said he had been called), was getting uncomfortably
warm, and said, “We are long enough at this work, we had
better go out and take a walk.” When out thus cooling themselves,
they passed a smithy door, at which an old white horse
was standing with the point of its hind shoe resting on the
ground. The wolf having gone over to it, but at a safe distance,
and looking intently at the door, said to the fox, “I wish, as
your eyesight is better than mine and you can read better than
I can, that you would come over and read the name written on
the horse shoe.”</p>

<p>The fox came over but could see no writing on the shoe, but
flattered by the wolf’s words, and not liking to confess that his
eyesight was failing, it went closer and the horse lifting its foot
knocked its brains out.</p>

<p>“I see,” said the wolf, “the greatest scholars are not always
the wisest clerks,” (<i>Cha ’n i an ro-sgoilearachd a ’s fhearr.&mdash;Lit.</i>&mdash;Excessive
scholarship is not always the best).</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_FOX_AND_THE_BIRD">THE FOX AND THE BIRD.</h3>
</div>


<p>In the foregoing the fox appears true to his character as an
unscrupulous, grasping, wily wretch, and in the following he
appears as over reached by a bird. Considering the character
the fox bears, one is glad when he is paid back in his own coin.
The bird in the tale is by some rendered Kestrel Hawk, and
by others Hen Harrier. The story was heard in Tiree, in which
are no trees on which the bird could sit, and no hawks or foxes
to make the story applicable. The lesson which the fable implies
is one that is useful everywhere.</p>

<p>A <i>Deargan-allt, Eun Fionn</i>, was dosing by a river side, when
a Fox came and caught it, and was going to devour it. “Oh
don’t, don’t,” said the bird, “and I will lay an egg as big as
your head.”</p>

<p>He protested this so loudly, and so solemnly, that the fox
loosened his hold till the bird at last flew up into a tree. Here
sitting on a branch, and safe from further injury, it said to the
fox, “I will not lay an egg as big as your head, for I cannot do
it, but I will give you three pieces of advice, and if you will
observe them, they will do you more good in the future. One,
first, “Never believe an unlikely story from unreliable authority
(<i>Na creid naigheachd mi-choltach fo urrainn mi-dhealbhach</i>).
Secondly, “Never make a great fuss about a small matter (<i>Na
dean dearmail mhòr mu rud beag</i>), and thirdly”&mdash;here the bird
seemed to take time, and the fox having his curiosity now
excited listened, though it was with firmly clasped teeth and
pangs of hunger&mdash;“Whatever you get a hold of, take a firm
hold of it” (<i>Rud air an dean thu greim, dean greim gu ro-mhath
air</i>), saying this, the bird flew away, and the fox, thus neatly
sold, was left lamenting.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_WREN">THE WREN.</h3>
</div>


<p>In the Fables relating to animals the fox readily takes a lead,
and is characterised as an unscrupulous and unprincipled rascal.
Next to him the wren, which is the smallest (or at least has the
name of being so) of British birds figures, and has got the name
not only of being small, but also of being forward and pert.
The first or most prominent of these fables is that in which the
wren appears as contesting with the eagle the supremacy among
birds, and this story may be said to be as widely extended over
the Highlands as the birds themselves. There was to be a
contest which bird should fly highest, and the wren jumped
upon the eagle’s back. When the eagle had soared as high as
it could, it said, “Where are you now, brown wren?” (<i>C’ àite
bheil thu, dhreathan donn?</i>). The wren jumped up a little higher
and said, “Far, far, above you” (<i>Fada fada fos do chionn</i>).
In consequence of this extraordinary feat the wren has twelve
eggs while the eagle has only two.</p>

<p>Natural historians assert that the number of wren’s eggs in
one nest seldom exceed eight, but others have stated that the
most number is twelve or even fourteen. In these tales which
have been got together in the West Highlands, the number is
uniformly said to be twelve, but whether this is actually the
case or merely an assumption, there is no call here for enquiring.</p>

<p>The wren and his twelve sons were threshing corn in a barn,
when a fox entered and claimed one of the workers for his
prize. It was agreed, since he must get some one, that it should
be the old wren, if he himself could point him out from the
rest. The thirteen wrens were so much alike that the fox was
puzzled. At last he said, “It is easy to distinguish the stroke
of the old hero himself” (<i>’S fhurasda buille an t-sean laoich
aithneachadh</i>). On hearing this, the old wren gave himself a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
jauntier air, and said, “there was a day when such was the case”
(<i>Bha latha dha sin</i>). After this the fox had no difficulty, for
boasting was always illfated (<i>bha tubaist air a’ bhòsd riamh</i>)
and he took his victim without any dispute.</p>

<p>On another occasion the wren and his twelve sons were
going to the peatmoss, when they fell in with a plant of great
virtue and high esteem. The old wren caught hold of the
plant by the ears, and was jerking it this way and that way,
hard-binding it, and pulling it, as if peat-slicing; white was his
face and red his cheek, but he failed to pull the plant from the
bare surface of the earth: the plant of virtues and blessings&mdash;(<i>Bha
e ’ga dhudadh null ’s ’ga dhudadh nall, ’ga chruaidh-cheangal
’s ’ga bhuain-mòine; bu gheal a shnuadh ’s bu dhearg
a ghruaidh, ’s cha tugadh e Meacain o chraicionn loma na
talmhain; Meacan nam buadh ’s nam beannachd</i>).</p>

<p>The wren called for the assistance of one of his sons, saying,
“Over here one of my sons to help me” (<i>An so aon eallach
mo mhac nall</i>), and they caught the plant in the same way,
jerking it this way and that way, hard-binding and peat-slicing
with it; white were their faces and red their cheeks, but they
could not with all their ardour, and their utmost strength pull
the plant from the bare surface of the earth: the plant of
virtues and blessings (<i>’S bha iad ’ga dhudadh null ’s ’ga dhudadh
nall, ’ga chruaidh-cheangal ’s ’ga bhuain-mòine; bu gheal an
snuadh ’s bu dearg an gruaidh ach le ’n uile dhichioll ’s le ’n
cruaidh-neart cha tugadh iad am Meacan o chraicionn loma na
talmhain: Meacan nam buadh ’s nam beannachd</i>).</p>

<p>“Over here with two of my sons to help me” (<i>An so dà
eallach mo mhac nall</i>), and the same operation was again performed
unsuccessfully, and in the same way one after another,
until the whole twelve sons came to the assistance of the old
wren. Then they grasped it altogether, and under the severe
strain the plant at last yielded, and all the wrens fell backwards
into a peat pond and were drowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>The old man from whom this story was heard said, that in
winter time, when knitting straw ropes for thatching, he could
get all the boys of the village to come to assist him, and keep
him company, and this they did with cheerfulness on the
understanding that the story of “The wren and his twelve
sons” would be illustrated at the end. One after another of
the boys sat on the floor behind him, and he having a hold of
the straw rope was able easily to resist the strain till he choose
to let go, then all the boys fell back and the laughter that
ensured was ample reward for their labour.</p>

<p>The fame of the wren for its forwardness and impudence is
also illustrated by a story current in the south of Scotland,
about Robin Redbreast having fallen sick, and the wren paying
him a visit, and expressing great condolence when, after making
his will, Robin dismissed her, saying, “Gae pack oot at my
chamber door, ye cuttie quean.” In Gaelic the wren is also
known by the name of <i>Dreòllan</i>, and <i>Dreathan-donn</i>, and the
name as applied to human beings means a weakly, imbecile,
trifling person, in whatever he takes in hand to do.</p>

<p>All the other birds in the same manner have their own share
of actions ascribed to them, and the manner in which several
of them made a brag of their own young is amusing&mdash;particularly
in Gaelic, in which the call ascribed to them is more
capable of imitation, and particularly in the light of the manner
in which the young of those who make the boast are looked
upon.</p>

<p>“Gleeful, gleeful,” said the Gull, “my young is the supreme
beauty.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sorry,” said the Hooded Crow, “but my son is the
little Blue Chick.”</p>

<p>“Croak, croak,” said the Raven, “it is my son that can pick
the lambs.”</p>

<p>“Click, click,” said the Eagle, “it is my son that is lord over
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>(“<i>Glìtheag, glitheag,” ors an Fhaoilean, “’se mo mhac-sa an
Daogheal Donn.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Gurra, gurra,” thuirt an Fheannag, “’se mo mo mhac-sa an
Garrach Gorm.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Gnog, gnog,” ors am Fitheach, “’s e mo mhac-sa ’chriomas na
h-uain.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Glig, glig,” thuirt an Iolaire, “’s e mo mhac-sa ’s tighearna
oirbh.</i>”)</p>

<p>In the Highlands the young gull is called <i>Sgliùrach</i> which is
the regular name for a slatternly young woman. It is seen
in the midst of a storm alighting in the hollows, and restfully
gliding to the highest summits of the waves.</p>

<p>The hooded crow’s fancy for its own young has passed into
a proverb, “The hooded crow thinks its own impertinent blue
progeny pretty” (<i>’S bòidheach leis an fheannaig a garrach
gorm fhein</i>”).</p>

<p>Of the Raven it is commonly said, that it is so fond of its
victim’s eyes that it will not even give them to its own young. Its
supernatural knowledge of where carrion is to be found amounts
almost to instinct, and is among the vices (<i>Dubhailcean</i>) ascribed
to the bard.</p>

<p>The eagle can only fly from an elevated situation, from the
difficulty of getting wind under its wings, and in this respect
forms a great contrast to the little wren.</p>

<p>Of other tales in which the lower animals figure, the three
following are noticeable.</p>

<p>Regarding this description of the deer-hound it deserves
notice that the word <i>Màrt</i>, translated March, denotes any busy
time of the year, there being a màrt, or busy season in harvest
as well as in spring, <i>Màrt Fogharaidh</i> as well as in <i>Màrt
Earraich</i>, and that in the islands meal made with the Quern
(<i>Bràthuin</i>), and from brown oats, which are the kind of oats
most common in these islands, is stronger and more nourishing
food than common meal. The merits of goat’s milk are well
known. This description of the best kind of deer-hound is
striking, and was taken down from a reciter in Skye.</p>

<p id="THE_TWO_HORSES">II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Two Horses.</span> Two horses were standing side by

work, said, “We will plough this ridge and then that other
ridge and after that the next one, and once we have commenced
we will do every ridge in sight, and once we have fairly
commenced we will not be long in doing the whole field.” The
old horse, who had experience of the work, said, “We will
plough this furrow itself first.”</p>

always annoying him, and barking at him. One day he caught<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
the little cur, and gave him a squeeze and sent it off yelping.
When the cur recovered itself it said, “I will not hurt you or
touch you, but I will raise an ill report (<i>droch-alla</i>) about you.”
In pursuance of his threat the cur went among his acquaintances,
and such as he himself was. There are many dogs to be
found in every town.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse outdent">“Both mongrel puppy whelp and hound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And curs of low degree.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>and to such the cur related how the big dog for all his smooth
appearance and apparent good nature was in reality a cruel,
deceitful dog and under all his apparent or seeming good
manners, he was ready to fall upon those weaker than himself,
whether they gave him cause or not, and if he could do it
without being observed give them a bad shaking. He was a
dangerous dog and ought to be watched and no wise dog should
put himself in his way.</p>

<p>This calumny made its way, found many believers and at
last produced its natural fruit. The big honest dog found his
company avoided and every body looking upon him with
suspicion.</p>

<p>At first the depression, and gloom which haunted him disappeared
under a hearty run, and the patting of its master, but
it preyed so much on him that he came to avoid society, and
to be apparently indifferent to any company. This happens in
the experiences of life, and that causeless and evil reports are
most dangerous in their consequences. Some time afterwards
the cur was similarly dealt with by another cur, who like himself
had not very high principles.</p>

<p class="ph3 center">BOY’S GAMES.</p>

<p class="p1_5">In the Highlands of Scotland, as in every other place where
there are children, youthful plays and amusements had their
sway, and it is worthy of attention how these amusements were
eminently calculated to develop and strengthen mind and
muscular strength in the young. The various amusements of
Riddles, and the many forms of indoor or house games are too
numerous to describe, and in many instances not worth while
dwelling upon. These games particularly called out the power
of close attention and of ready speech, and were as often played
out of doors as indoors, according to weather.</p>


<p class="center" id="KING_AND_KITE">I.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wrestling Matches.</span></p>

<p>When the youth of a village met at a <i>céilidh</i>, or indoor
gathering, and a wrestling match was resolved upon, one of
them was appointed a king or master of the ceremonies, and the
company was bound to be obedient to him in everything. In
the following game a stout and likely lad was fixed upon to
come in, in the character of a “Desert Glede” (<i>Croman Fàsaich</i>).
When he came in, the following speech occurred: addressing
the king, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Croman.</i></p>

<p>“Leigeadh da, leigeadh da, Dia,”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Righ.</i></p>

<p>“Co as a thàinig thu, a Chromain Fhàsaich, no ’de an dràsda
thug so thu?”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Croman.</i></p>

<p>“Thàinig mi a m’ fhonn ’s a m’ fhearann, ’s a m’ fhàsach
fhéin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Righ.</i></p>

<p>“’Dé chuir fearann ’s fonn ’s fàsach agadsa ’s mise gun
fhonn gun fhearann gun fhàsach.”?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Croman.</i></p>

<p>“Mo chruas, ’s mo luathas, ’s mo làidireachd fhéin.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Righ.</i></p>

<p>“Tha òganach geur donn agamsa a leagadh tu, ’s a bhreabadh
tu, ’s a bheireadh sia deug dh’ iallan do dhroma asad, agus
iall g’ ad cheangal; ’s a mhi-mhodhaicheadh do bhean ann an
clais na h-inne ’s tu fhéin ceangailte.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Croman.</i></p>

<p>“Cuir a mach so e ma ta.”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="center"><i>Kite, or Glede.</i></p>

<p>“Permit, permit, O Deity.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>King.</i></p>

<p>“Where have you come from, Kite of the Desert, and what
has now brought you here?”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Kite.</i></p>

<p>“I come from my own land and soil and desert.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>King.</i></p>

<p>“How have you land and soil and desert, when I have
neither land nor soil nor desert?”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Kite.</i></p>

<p>“My own hardiness and swiftness and strength.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>King.</i></p>

<p>“I have a smart brown-haired youth, who can throw you
down, and kick you, and take sixteen thongs out of your back,
and a thong to tie you with, and who can throw your wife into
the byre gutter while you yourself are tied.”</p>

<p class="center"><i>Kite.</i></p>

<p>“Send him out here then.”</p>

<p>The wrestling then began, and the one who proved victor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
became “Desert Glede” for the next encounter, until the
whole were run over.</p>

<p>The words were sometimes used in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Righ.</i>&mdash;“Dida-a-didacha-dìsa, a Chromain Fhàsaich, co as
dràsda a choisich thu?”</p>

<p><i>Croman.</i>&mdash;“Feuch ’bheil gìomanach donn agad a chumas
rium.”</p>

<p><i>Righg.</i>&mdash;“Tha agamsa gìomanach donn a chumas riut ’s a
dheanadh loth pheallagach dhiot aig dorus an tighe, etc.”</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p><i>King.</i>&mdash;“Deeda-a-deedacha-deesa, Desert Glede, whence
have you walked from now?”</p>

<p><i>Kite.</i>&mdash;“Try whether you have a brown-haired youth to
match me.”</p>

<p><i>King.</i>&mdash;“I have a brown-haired youth that will match you
and make a matted colt of you at the door of the house, etc.”</p>

<hr class="tb"/>

<p id="PARSONS_MARE">Another game popular on these occasions was one of forfeits,
known as the “Parson’s mare has gone amissing,” (<i>Làir a’
pharsonaich air chall</i>). Every boy and girl in the company
has a false name, given for the occasion, such as “Old Cow’s
Tail” (<i>Earball Seana Mhairt</i>); “Rooster on the House-top”
(<i>Coileach air Tigh</i>), etc. The king, or overseer, commencing
the game says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The parson’s mare has gone amissing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And it is a great shame that it should be so;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Try who stole her.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4">Làir a’ pharsonaich air chall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">’S mòr an nàire dh’ i bhi ann;</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Feuch cò ghoid i.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Looking round the circle, he fixes upon some one, and
mentions him by the assumed name. He fixes, for instance,
on the one to whom the name of “Old Cow’s Tail” was given,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
and the person mentioned or denoted was bound at once to
answer, saying</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“It’s a lie from you”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(’S breugach dhuit e)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>to which the answer is,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Who then is it?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">(Feuch cò eile e?).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The person accused at once passes it on by mentioning some
one else, such as the “Rooster on the House top,” and the
same query and answer, “Who then is it?”, etc., is passed on.
The first one who fails in giving a ready reply has to submit to
give a forfeit which the ruler keeps in security till all have been
exacted; then some one bends down and rests his head upon
the king’s knee, when the forfeits are held upon his head and
he is made to award the punishment of redeeming them. He
does not see whose forfeit it is, and the penalty imposed is
sometimes very ludicrous and impossible. One, for instance,
has to sit on the fire till his stomach boils (<i>Suidhe air an teine
gus am bi a ghoile air ghoil</i>); another is to go out to the hillock
in front of the village and bawl out three times,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This is the one who did the mischief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And who will do it to-night yet.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">(’S mise an duine a rinn an t-olc</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’S nì mi ’n nochd fhathast e).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This game requires great readiness and retentiveness of mind.
The attention being kept continually on the strain in case one’s
own assumed name be called out, and a readiness to pass the
accusation on to another.</p>

<hr class="r10"/>

<p id="HIDE_AND_SEEK">The game of “Hide and Seek” was practised in the Highlands
in many forms. Probably the earliest and simplest is
that of young children playing round their mother, while she
was engaged in baking bread. It was the custom in olden
times to gather the meal or remains of dough left over after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
the oatcakes of bread were made, and duly work it into a cake
by itself, called the <i>Bonnach Beag</i>, or “Little Cake,” also
known as <i>Siantachan a’ Chlàir</i>, “The Charmer of the Board,”
which was supposed to be of mysterious value in keeping want
away from the house. This little cake was given to the children,
and when butter was ready or accessible, was thickly
covered and given to the little fry, making a very welcome and
grateful treat. Sometimes when the butter was very thickly
spread, and perhaps with the thumb as the readiest and most
convenient substitute for a knife, the housewife said, “Here
take that; it is better than a hoard of cloth” (Gabh sin;
’s fhearr e na mìr liath ’an clùd). Hence the expression that
was used to denote that the preparations were not quite over:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“Cha ’n ’eil am bonnach beag bruich fhathast.”<br />
(The little cake is not ready yet).<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Not infrequently the little things hid their heads under their
mother’s apron, thinking, like the ostrich of the desert that if
their heads were hidden, none of the rest of them would be
seen. When children played the game in the open air, the
stackyard was commonly resorted to, and the one who was fixed
upon as the Blind Man, while the rest were hiding themselves
had to call out three times,</p>

<p class="center">
“Opera-opera-bo-baideag”<br />
</p>

<p>adding at the third time,</p>

<p>“Dalladh agus bodharadh agus dìth na dà chluais air an fhear
nach cuala sud.”</p>

<p>(Blindness and deafness and the loss of both ears be the lot of
the one who will not hear that).</p>

<p>The Blind-man then caught hold of one of the stacks, and went
round, guided by his hands, giving occasional kicks in case any
one should be hiding himself near the ground.</p>

<h3 class="mb0" id="PORT_NAN_LONG">II.&mdash;PORT-NAN-LONG.</h3>

<p class="center">(Page 52).</p>

<p><i>Port-nan-long</i> is said to have got its name from the following
circumstance:&mdash;About the year 500 A.D., the few inhabitants
then living in Tiree were in the township and neighbourhood
of Sorabi, where there was a chapel, and which lies on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
south-east side of the island, and is separated by the stream of
the same name running past the burying-ground into the bay,
from the township of Balinoe (<i>Baile-nodha</i>). The island
having been previously desolated by pirates and cattle-raiders,
and a rumour being heard at this time that a band of these had
again returned among the islands to renew their depredations,
a watch was kept, and the factor of the community, who appears
to have been their only protector and counsellor, went daily
to look seawards for the appearance of the enemy, lest the
small and feeble band might be surprised before they could
make their escape or reach a hiding-place. One day then he
saw ships coming from the south-east, and he went in and sent
word to his neighbours. When he looked again, the ships were
nearer and were a large fleet. The next look he gave he saw
that they were close at hand, near the land. He then called
the people round him, and told them how he could see that
their enemies, who were near, were too powerful to be resisted;
that as he himself and those with him were defenceless, and
unable to escape, their only hope of deliverance from their
terrible danger was in the power of Almighty God, whose aid
he would ask, and kneeling on the ground with his friends and
neighbours around him, he said, “O Lord, as all power is in
thy hand, help us against these enemies who are coming on us
(to destroy us)”; (<i>A Thighearna, o ’n a’s ann ad làimh a tha
gach cumhachd, cuidich leinn o na naimhdean sin a tha ’tighinn
oirnn!</i>). He had scarcely uttered the last word when a violent
storm came from the south-east, and the ships of the enemy
came ashore, one heaped above another (<i>air muin a’ chéile</i>).
Sixteen of them were completely destroyed. One person even
was not left to tell their fate; and from that time the place has
been called <i>Port-nan-long</i>, (the Creek of Boats).</p>

<h3 id="TRADITION_OF_MORAR">III.&mdash;A TRADITION OF MORAR.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mac vic Ailein of Morar</span> (<i>Mòr-thìr</i>) was out in a shealing
with his men, on a summer morning, and saw a young woman
following cows, with her petticoats gathered to keep them dry,
as the dew was heavy on the ground (<i>a còtaichean truiste, le
truimead an driùchd, g’ an cumail tioram</i>). He said, “Would
not that be a handsome young woman if her two legs were not
so slender (<i>mur biodh caoilead a dà choise</i>).” She answered in
his hearing, “Often a slender-shanked cow has a large udder<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
(<i>is minig a bha ùth mhòr aig bò chaol-chasach</i>).” He asked her
to be brought where he was; she was his own dairymaid. She
went away to Ireland, and named her son Murdoch after his
foster-father (<i>oide</i>), whom she afterwards married. He was
known as Little Murdoch MacRonald (<i>Murcha beag Mac
Raonuill</i>). As he grew older his mother would be telling him
about a brother he had in Alban (<i>an Albainn</i>) who was a
strong and powerful man, and the lad, being a good wrestler,
thought he would like to go and see him, to try a bout of
wrestling (<i>car-gleachd</i>) with him, to find which of them was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
strongest man, and watched for an opportunity to get to Alban.
As there was frequent communication then between Ireland
and the Western Highlands he had not long to wait till he saw
a boat in which it was likely he would be taken. He went to
the harbour and on reaching the boat, without knowing that it
belonged to his brother, asked the first person he met, who was
<i>Mac vic Ailein</i> himself, if he would get ferried across to Scotland
(<i>dh’ iarr e ’n t-aiseag</i>). <i>Mac vic Ailein</i> said that he would
take him with them. When they went away the day became
stormy (<i>shéid an latha</i>), and no one who went to steer but was
lifted from the helm,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> <i>Mac vic Ailein</i> being thrown aside as
well as the others. When <i>Murcha beag Mac Raonuill</i> saw that
the strongest man among them could not stand at the helm, he
asked to be allowed to try it. “You would get that,” <i>Mac vic
Ailein</i> said, “if you were like a man who was able to do it, but
when it is beyond our strength (<i>’nuair a dh’ fhairtlich i oirnn
fhéin</i>), you need not make the attempt.” “At any rate,” he
said “I will give it a trial”: and it did not make him alter
his position (<i>cha do chuir i thar a bhuinn e</i>) till they reached
land. As he was the best seaman <i>Mac vic Ailein</i> would not
part with him. He took him to his house and entertained him
as a guest. They entered into conversation and began to give
news to each other (<i>chaidh iad gu seanachas agus gu naigheachdan</i>)
till little Murdoch told him he was his brother and
that it was for the express purpose (<i>a dh’ aon obair</i>) of
seeing him he had come from Ireland, and that he would not
return till they tried a bout of wrestling, since <i>Mac vic Ailein</i>
was so renowned for his prowess, and he would find out what
strength he possessed before he left. The heroes rose and
began to wrestle, but in a short time <i>Mac vic Ailein</i> was thrown
(<i>Dh’ éirich na suinn, ach ann an tiota bha Mac ’ic Ailein ’s a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
dhruim ri talamh</i>). “I am pleased to have taken the trouble
of coming from Ireland (<i>toilichte as mo shaothair</i>),” Murdoch
said. Next day at dinner they had beef on the table, and little
Murdoch said, “Let us try which of us can break the shank
bone<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (<i>a’ chama-dhubh</i>) with the hand closed.” “I am willing,”
<i>Mac vic Ailein</i> said. “Well, try it, then,” Murdoch said.
<i>Mac vic Ailein</i> tried as hard as his strength would permit,
and it defied him (<i>dh’ fhairtlich i air</i>). Murdoch broke it at
the first blow. <i>Mac vic Ailein</i> then said, “You will not return
to Ireland any more; you will stay with me, and we will divide
the estate between us.” Murdoch replied, “I am well to do

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> In the oldest known version of the Exile of the Son of Usnech
(preserved in the 12th century MS., the Book of Leinster) when Noisi
sees Deirdre for the first time, he exclaims, ‘’Tis a fair heifer passing
by me.’ She answers, ‘Where the bulls are there must needs be fine
heifers.’ This is one of the passages relied upon by Prof. Zimmer in
support of his contention that old Irish literature is so extremely
‘naturalistic’ in its treatment of sexual matters that we must needs
suppose the Aryan Celts were polluted by a rude and more archaic
population. I confess I see nothing in either the earlier or the present
passage but the simplicity of a race living, 2000 years ago, as it
still in part does, very close to nature, and accustomed to frank
speaking about natural matters. The whole of this tradition is simply
the fitting into a local frame of incidents which are commonplaces in
the folk-tales.&mdash;A. N.</p>

<h3 id="CORRESPONDENCE">IV.&mdash;CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN J. F. CAMPBELL
OF ISLAY AND J. G. CAMPBELL.</h3>

<p>Among the treasures regarding folk-lore that I have been able
to collect are a few letters of the late J. F. Campbell of Islay to
the Rev. J. G. Campbell, late Minister of Tiree. They deal
with various questions and traditions.</p>

<p><i>Inter alia</i> is a discussion concerning the word sàil versus sìol
Dhiarmaid. I give the letters as written.</p>

With regard to sàil there was once an actor who amused an audience
by putting his head under his cloak and squealing like a pig. A
countryman rose and said that he would squeal better next day. So
a match was made and tried. The audience applauded the actor and
hissed the countryman. But he produced a pig from under his cloak.
I know what the man meant who signed Sàil Dhiarmaid. The man
who spoke no other language pointed
to the place in his foot which he meant
by Sàil, so I learned the lesson, and
anybody who will try may learn a good
deal about Gaelic in the same fashion.</p>

<p>If a man starts with the conviction
that knowledge is to the unknown as a
drop in the ocean&mdash;he will get on.</p>

<p>I have MacNicol, and know his
remark about Ossian’s leg.</p>

<p>I have now got the only copy that ever was written, so far as I
know, and I shall be glad to get more. But we must all take what
we can get. As far as fixing the king or the country and the date,
that is perfectly hopeless. I have about 16 versions of one story in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Gaelic, and no two have the same name. I suppose that there must
be sixty versions of it known in other languages, and no two are
alike. The oldest I know is scattered in ejaculations and separate
lines through the Rigveda Sanhitâ, which is a collection of
hymns in Sanscrit, and the oldest things known. St. George and the
Dragon is a form of the story. Perseus and Andromeda is another.
In Gaelic it is generally <i>Mac an Iasgair</i>, or <i>Iain Mac</i> somebody, or
<i>Fionn Mac a’ Bhradain</i>, a something to do with a mermaid or a
dragon, the herding of cows and the slaying of giants. The stories
to which I referred were told me by John Ardfenaig as facts (the Duke
of Argyll’s factor in the Ross of Mull). A man built a boat. Another,
to spite him, said that the death of a man was in that boat&mdash;no one
would go to sea in it, and at last the boat was sold by the builder to
an unbeliever in ghosts and dreams. The other was how the turnips
were protected in Tiree. If you know these you have got far, but if
not you have a good deal to learn in Tiree.</p>

<p class="p0 pindent">I have been too busy about festivities and work
to be able to get the book which I promised to seek for you. I got
your letter of the 20th, yesterday, and I am much obliged by your
promise to put some one to write for me. If he writes from dictation
will you kindly <i>beg him to follow the words spoken</i> without regard to
his own opinion, or to what they ought to be. I speak English, but
when I come to read Chaucer I find words that I am not used to. So
it is when men who speak Gaelic begin to write old stories. Our
argument is an illustration. You speak Gaelic and you believe that
Sàil means heel and nothing else. You told me that Sàil Dhiarmaid
ought to be Sìol.</p>

<p>Now I speak Gaelic, but I profess to be a scholar, not a teacher.
I happen to know that the man who signed Sàil Dhiarmaid, which
was printed <i>Sàil</i> didn’t mean <i>Sìol</i>. I have the following quotation,&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">From John Cameron, a man about 60, who lives in the south end of

1.&mdash;The Maiden (written by J. F. C.); 2.&mdash;The Death of Diarmaid;
3.&mdash;The Death of Osgar; 4.&mdash;The Battle of Manus (written by J. F.

story written; and sundry other songs, lays, and stories, which he
will get written if I wish it. This is one of about a dozen of
men whom I have met of late who can sing and recite Ossianic
ballads, of which some are not in any book or old manuscript that I
know. I have another version of this song, written about ten years
ago&mdash;by MacLean,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> I think. See Vol. IV. Popular Tales, Lists
somewhere. It is now in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<h4 class="mb0" title=""><span class="smcap">The Fairy Song.</span></h4>

<p>The tune is very wild and like a pibroch. I could not learn
it in the time.</p>


<p class="center p1_5"><i>This is the story as told in Gaelic.</i></p>

<p class="p1_5">There was a time, at first, when before children were christened
they used to be taken by the fairies. A child was born
and it was in a woman’s lap. A fairy came to the <i>Bean-ghlùn</i>
and she said to the midwife, “<i>’S trom do leanabh</i>.” “<i>’S trom
gach torrach</i>,” said the other. “<i>’S aotrom do leanabh</i>,” said the
fairy. “<i>’S aotrom gach soghalach</i>,” said the midwife, “<i>’S glas
do leanabh</i>,” said the fairy. “<i>’S glas am fiar ’s fàsaidh e</i>,” said
the other; and so she came day by day with words and with
singing of verses to try if she could “word” him away with
her&mdash;“<i>am briatharachadh i leatha è</i>.” But the mother always
had her answer ready. There was a lad recovering from a
fever in the house and he heard all these words, and learned
them, and he put the song together afterwards: after the child
was christened the fairy came back no more.</p>

<p>This is the song. I have tried to divide the words so as to
represent the rhythm of the tune, but I am not sure that I have
succeeded.&mdash;J. F. C.</p>

<p>I have given a rough copy to Miss MacLeod of MacLeod at
Dunvegan, and I should like to have <i>this</i> or <i>a copy</i> back if it is
not troublesome. My first manuscript is not easy to read, and
I have worked this from it.</p>

<p><i>The Fairy Song</i> in the MS. is most difficult to read. It was
written phonetically, and is now in some places indistinct. The
following transliteration and translation by Mr. Duncan Mac
Isaac, of Oban, show a probable reading, and this may be
enough, in view of the spell-words of the fairy, whose mystic
diction appears to have been of a conservative quality, and
to have affected the responses of the infant’s mother.&mdash;[A. C.]</p>

<p>The late Campbell of Islay in the following letter, extracts
of which will be given, alludes to Mr. Campbell’s intention of
publishing at no distant date.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right mr5 p2">
<span class="smcap">Niddry Lodge</span>, Jan., 16, 1871.
</p>

<p>I thank you for your letter of the 10th which reached me on
Saturday, on my return to Tiree.</p>

<p>I shall be very glad to assist a namesake and a Highland minister
who is engaged in literary work, in which I take a special interest
myself. I now repeat my message, and ask you to place my name
on the list of subscribers, if you have one. I shall be very glad to
read your book. I am not publishing more Gaelic tales, but I am
collecting, and I may some day publish a selection or an abstract or
something from a great mass which I have got together. If you
have anything to spare from your gatherings perhaps the best plan
would be to employ some good scribe, etc. etc. etc. If you have any
intention of publishing I beg that you will not think of sending me
your gatherings. But anything sent will be carefully preserved.</p>

<p>Superstitions are very interesting, but I should fear that the people
will not confide their superstitions to the minister. Amongst other
matters which are noteworthy are superstitious practices about fowls.</p>

<p>These prevail in Scotland, and are identical with sacrifices by the
blacks amongst whom Speke and Grant travelled&mdash;so Grant told me.
Anything to do with serpents has special interest because of the extent
of ancient serpent worship, for which see Ferguson’s great book on
Tree and Serpent Worship in India and elsewhere. The connection
between tree and well worship in India and in Scotland generally, and
generally in the old world, is well worth investigation; also anything
that is like the Vedic forms of religion, at which you can get by reading
Wilson’s Translation of the Rigveda Sanhitâ, and the works of
Max Muller. Anything belonging specially to the sea is interesting.
The Aryans are supposed to have been natives of Central Asia, to
whom the sea must have been a great mystery.</p>

<p>Now it is a fact that all the Aryan nations have curious beliefs and
ceremonies and practices about going to sea, <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;you must not
whistle at sea; you must not name a mouse <i>Luds</i> in Argyll but <i>Biast
tighe</i>; you must not say the shore names for <i>fine</i> or <i>low</i> when at sea,
but use sea terms; all that is curious and very hard to get at. Even
to me they will not confess their creed in the supernatural. I have
a great lot of stuff that might be useful to you, and I shall be glad to
serve you, because there is a certain narrow-minded spirit abroad to
which reference is made in the paper which I send herewith. It is
highly probable that I may be out in the west in spring or summer.</p>

<p class="mb0 right mr15">
Yours very truly,</p>
<p class="p0 right mr5">J. F. CAMPBELL.

<p>The following letter refers to the longest and most complex
tale orally preserved in the Highlands, ‘The Leeching of
Kian’s Leg.’ The version which Islay mentions is still unprinted.
It is preserved with a portion of his MSS. in the
Advocate’s Library at Edinburgh, and a summary of its contents
has been published by me in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, Vol. I., p. 369. Mr.
Campbell’s fragmentary version was printed and translated by
him, ‘Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness, 1888.’
Another fragmentary version, collected by the Rev. D. MacInnes,
will be found in Vol. II. of this series. The oldest
known MS. version, alluded to in this letter, has been edited
and translated by Mr. Standish Hayes O’Grady in <i>Silva
Gadelica</i>, from a 15th century MS. A re-telling of the story,
based upon all the versions, will be found in Mr. Jacob’s
<i>More Celtic Fairy Tales</i>.&mdash;A. N.</p>

May, 4, 71. <span class="smcap">Niddry Lodge,</span></p>

<p class="mr15 p0 right"><span class="smcap">Kensington.</span></p>

<p class="mb0">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,
</p>

<p class="p0">I sent you a <i>Times</i> review of Clerk’s Ossian the
other day to amuse you; also a paper with an account of fighting in
Paris, where I was at Easter.</p>

<p>I got your letter and parcel of May 1, last night, and I have just
read the story. It is extremely well written, and the language is
vernacular and perfectly genuine: as I have now got 20 volumes, and
half another, I am able to judge. Yours is a version of the story of
which I sent you the abstract. If ever I publish the story I see that
I must fuse versions, and select from the majority of various readings,
under the name of “The Leching of Khene is legg.” The story is
mentioned in the Catalogue of the Earl of Kildare’s library amongst
the Irish Books, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1526 (Harleian MSS., 3756, Brit. Museum). I
gave this information to Kildare, who has been hunting high and
low to find out what was meant, they could not tell him in Ireland.
I met him at Lorne’s marriage and lent him my copy, 142 pages from
oral recitation. Now you send me 19 more pages, and 3 of another
version, 22. Between us we have already recovered something of a
story 345 years old at least.</p>

<p>Therefore Tradition is respectable; a comparison of versions gives
a fair measure of the power of popular memory, so that written Gaelic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
folk-lore is a kind of measure for other and older written traditions.
But as all that is old in history was tradition at first, the study is
worth trouble as I judge. The more we can get written the better
pleased I shall be. I am exceedingly obliged to you, and hope to
thank you in person some of these days.</p>

<p class="center"><b>Transcriber’s Note</b></p>

<p>Obvious printer’s errors have been silently corrected; as far
as possible, however, original spelling and formatting have been retained.
No corrections have been made to any Gaelic text as printed, with the sole
exception of the third occurence of “Fire fire nì mi umad”
on page 145, which had been misprinted.</p>

<p>In the printed book, an unnumbered page containing an editor’s note
was inserted between pages 34 and 35. In this file, the note has been
placed inside a box, given the subheading “Editor’s Note”, and moved directly
after the paragraph to which it seems to refer, on page 35.</p>

<p>Footnotes were presented inconsistently in the printed book, sometimes
appearing at the bottom of the page and sometimes at the ends of
sections. In this book, all notes have been standardised and moved to
the end of the relevant section, sometimes alongside a “Notes” section
which was already present.</p>

<p>In this file, the formatting of the “Boy’s Games” section, which was internally
inconsistent, has been standardised for the sake of clarity.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
